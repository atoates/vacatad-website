# Domain & SSL Investigation Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Investigation Time:** 13:30 GMT  
**Status:** Issue Identified & Fixed ✅

---

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### Issue Reported:
- ❌ `www.vacatad.com` showing SSL certificate error
- ❌ `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`
- ❌ No analytics traffic showing up

---

## ✅ DNS Configuration (PERFECT)

### A Records for `vacatad.com`:
```
185.199.108.153 ✅
185.199.109.153 ✅
185.199.110.153 ✅
185.199.111.153 ✅
```

### CNAME Record for `www.vacatad.com`:
```
www → atoates.github.io ✅
```

**DNS Status:** ✅ All configured correctly

---

## 🔍 SSL Certificate Investigation

### Test 1: `https://vacatad.com` (apex domain)
```bash
curl -sI https://vacatad.com
```
**Result:** ✅ **HTTP/2 200** - Working perfectly!
- SSL: Valid
- Server: GitHub.com
- Certificate: Provisioned correctly

### Test 2: `https://www.vacatad.com` (www subdomain)
```bash
curl -v https://www.vacatad.com
```
**Result:** ❌ **SSL certificate mismatch**
- Certificate received: `*.github.io`
- Certificate needed: `www.vacatad.com`
- Error: `SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name`

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

### The Problem:
The `CNAME` file in your repository contained:
```
vacatad.com
```

This tells GitHub Pages to provision an SSL certificate **only** for the apex domain (`vacatad.com`), NOT for the www subdomain.

### Why This Matters:
- GitHub Pages provisions SSL certificates based on the CNAME file
- If CNAME = `vacatad.com` → Certificate for apex only
- If CNAME = `www.vacatad.com` → Certificate for BOTH www and apex
- Users typing `www.vacatad.com` got a `*.github.io` certificate (mismatch!)

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed CNAME File:
**Before:**
```
vacatad.com
```

**After:**
```
www.vacatad.com
```

### What This Does:
1. ✅ GitHub Pages will provision SSL for `www.vacatad.com`
2. ✅ Also covers `vacatad.com` (apex domain)
3. ✅ Both URLs will work with HTTPS
4. ✅ GitHub handles redirects automatically

### Commit:
```
commit 0714e52
"Update CNAME to www.vacatad.com for proper SSL certificate provisioning"
```

---

## ⏳ What Happens Next

### Immediate (1-5 minutes):
- GitHub Pages detects the CNAME change
- Triggers SSL certificate provisioning
- Let's Encrypt generates new certificate

### Within 30-60 minutes:
- ✅ New SSL certificate issued for `www.vacatad.com`
- ✅ Certificate also covers `vacatad.com` (apex)
- ✅ Both URLs work with HTTPS
- ✅ No more certificate errors

### How GitHub Handles It:
```
User visits: vacatad.com
  → Redirects to: https://www.vacatad.com ✅

User visits: www.vacatad.com
  → Loads: https://www.vacatad.com ✅

User visits: http://vacatad.com
  → Redirects to: https://www.vacatad.com ✅

User visits: http://www.vacatad.com
  → Redirects to: https://www.vacatad.com ✅
```

## 📊 Analytics Investigation

### Why No Traffic Showing:
1. **SSL Certificate Error:** Users couldn't access the site via `www.vacatad.com`
2. **Browser Blocks:** Chrome/browsers block sites with invalid certificates (HSTS)
3. **No Page Load:** Analytics never fires if page doesn't load
4. **404 Error:** Site was unreachable due to certificate mismatch

### After Fix:
Once SSL is provisioned (30-60 min):
- ✅ Users can access the site
- ✅ Pages load successfully
- ✅ Analytics tracking fires
- ✅ Data appears in Google Analytics

### Analytics Status:
- **Configuration:** ✅ Perfect (G-DEZQKBTTFH on all 23 pages)
- **Code:** ✅ Deployed correctly
- **Issue:** ❌ Users couldn't access site (SSL error)
- **Fix:** ✅ Applied (waiting for certificate)

---

## 🔧 GitHub Pages Settings

### Current Configuration:
- **Repository:** atoates/vacatad-website
- **Branch:** main
- **Source:** / (root)
- **Custom Domain:** www.vacatad.com (updated via CNAME file)
- **HTTPS:** Will be enforced once certificate is issued

### Manual Check (Optional):
1. Go to: https://github.com/atoates/vacatad-website/settings/pages
2. Under **Custom domain**, you should see:
   - Domain: `www.vacatad.com`
   - Status: ⏳ "DNS check in progress" or ✅ "DNS check successful"
3. Once DNS verified:
   - ✅ Enable: **Enforce HTTPS**

---

## ✅ Verification Steps (In 1 Hour)

### Step 1: Check SSL Certificate
```bash
curl -sI https://www.vacatad.com
```
**Expected:** HTTP/2 200 (no SSL errors)

### Step 2: Check Apex Domain
```bash
curl -sI https://vacatad.com
```
**Expected:** HTTP/2 301 or 200 (redirects to www)

### Step 3: Visit in Browser
1. Open: https://www.vacatad.com
2. **Expected:** ✅ Green padlock, no warnings
3. Check: Site loads fully

### Step 4: Verify Analytics
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Navigate to: **Reports** → **Real-time**
3. Open: https://www.vacatad.com in another tab
4. **Expected:** ✅ See yourself as active user

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (If Issues Persist)

### If SSL error still showing after 1 hour:

**Option 1: Remove & Re-add Domain**
1. Go to: https://github.com/atoates/vacatad-website/settings/pages
2. Under "Custom domain", click **Remove**
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Re-enter: `www.vacatad.com`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait for DNS verification
7. Enable **Enforce HTTPS**

**Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
```bash
# Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
# Choose: "Cached images and files"
# Time range: "Last hour"
```

**Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode**
- Bypasses cached SSL errors
- Tests current certificate status

**Option 4: Check Certificate Directly**
```bash
echo | openssl s_client -servername www.vacatad.com -connect www.vacatad.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject -dates
```
**Expected:** Subject should include `www.vacatad.com`

## 📊 Why Analytics Wasn't Working

### The Full Story:

1. **User visits `www.vacatad.com`**
2. Browser requests SSL certificate
3. GitHub serves `*.github.io` certificate (wrong!)
4. Browser sees certificate mismatch
5. **HSTS policy enforced** - Browser blocks access
6. User sees: `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`
7. **Page never loads** → Analytics never fires
8. **No data** in Google Analytics

### After Fix:

1. **User visits `www.vacatad.com`**
2. Browser requests SSL certificate
3. GitHub serves `www.vacatad.com` certificate ✅
4. Browser validates certificate ✅
5. Page loads successfully ✅
6. **Analytics fires** ✅
7. **Data appears** in Google Analytics ✅

---

## ✅ Summary

### Problem:
- SSL certificate mismatch on `www.vacatad.com`
- CNAME file pointed to apex domain only
- Users blocked by browser security (HSTS)
- Analytics couldn't track (page didn't load)

### Solution:
- Updated CNAME file: `vacatad.com` → `www.vacatad.com`
- Triggers SSL certificate for both apex and www
- Users can access site once certificate provisions
- Analytics will track normally

### Timeline:
- **Now:** Fix deployed, waiting for SSL
- **1 hour:** Site fully accessible with HTTPS
- **Immediately after:** Analytics starts tracking

### Next Steps:
1. ⏳ Wait 30-60 minutes for SSL provisioning
2. ✅ Verify site accessible at https://www.vacatad.com
3. ✅ Check Google Analytics Real-time reports
4. 🎉 Celebrate successful deployment!
