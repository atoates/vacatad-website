                                <p>Business rates are a tax on commercial properties in England and Wales, paid by the occupier of the property.

                                <p>The VOA determines rateable values based on what the property could reasonably be expected to let for on the open market on a specific valuation date. They consider factors such as location, size, use, and market conditions. Valuations are typically updated every five years during revaluation cycles.</p>

Empty Property Relief provides 100% relief for the first three months, then 100% relief for properties with rateable values under £2,900, or no relief for higher-value properties unless they qualify for other reliefs.</p>
