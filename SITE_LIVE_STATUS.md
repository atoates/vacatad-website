# Domain Configuration - Final Resolution

**Date:** October 15, 2025, 14:50 GMT  
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - Site Live at https://vacatad.com  

---

## ✅ FINAL SOLUTION

### **Working Domain:**
**https://vacatad.com** ✅
- SSL: Valid and working
- Certificate: Properly configured
- Status: LIVE

### **CNAME Configuration:**
```
vacatad.com
```

### **Why This Works:**
- Apex domain SSL was already provisioned by GitHub
- Certificate valid and active
- No waiting period required
- Works immediately

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Timeline:
1. **13:30** - Changed CNAME to `www.vacatad.com` → Triggered SSL re-provisioning
2. **14:50** - SSL still not ready for www subdomain → Reverted to `vacatad.com`
3. **14:50** - Apex domain working immediately with valid SSL ✅

### Why www Didn't Work:
- SSL provisioning can take 1-24 hours for subdomains
- GitHub Pages prioritizes apex domains
- www requires additional DNS verification
- Apex domain already had valid certificate
