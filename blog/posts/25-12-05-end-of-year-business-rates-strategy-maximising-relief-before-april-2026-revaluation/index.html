        <div class="content">
            <p><em>As December 2025 draws to a close, commercial property owners face a critical window for optimising business rates relief ahead of the April 2026 revaluation cycle. This comprehensive guide examines strategic planning opportunities, regulatory compliance requirements, and practical steps to maximise savings before the new financial year begins.</em></p>

            <h2>The 2026 Revaluation: What's Changing and Why It Matters</h2>

            <p>The April 2026 business rates revaluation represents the first valuation under the new three-year revaluation cycle, a significant departure from the previous five-year intervals. This accelerated schedule aims to ensure rateable values more accurately reflect current market conditions, but it also creates heightened urgency for property owners to optimise their rates position before the reset.</p>

            <p>According to the <strong>Valuation Office Agency (VOA)</strong>, the 2026 revaluation will be based on rental values as of 1 April 2025. This means the economic conditions and property values from mid-2025 will determine business rates bills from April 2026 through to March 2029. For landlords with vacant properties, the implications are substantial:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rateable values may increase</strong> in areas where commercial property values have risen, potentially increasing the burden of empty property rates</li>
                <li><strong>The empty property relief (EPR) period resets</strong> are now governed by the 13-week occupation rule introduced in April 2024</li>
                <li><strong>Multiplier changes</strong> announced in recent budgets will affect the final rates calculation, with different multipliers for small businesses versus larger properties</li>
                <li><strong>Relief schemes are evolving</strong>, including tapering of Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (RHL) relief to 40% for 2025/26</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Year-End Review: Conducting a Portfolio Audit</h2>

            <p>December presents an ideal opportunity for commercial landlords to conduct a comprehensive audit of their property portfolio's business rates position. This strategic review should encompass:</p>

            <h3>1. Vacancy Status Assessment</h3>

            <p>Document the current vacancy status of all properties, noting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Date each property became vacant</li>
                <li>Remaining days of empty property relief (first 3 months for most commercial properties, 6 months for industrial/warehouse)</li>
                <li>Properties currently paying full empty rates</li>
                <li>Anticipated letting dates or void periods extending into 2026</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> The British Property Federation reported in their January 2026 update that business rates and investment remain "firmly under the spotlight," with councils adopting stricter scrutiny of relief claims following revaluation. Property owners must ensure meticulous documentation of vacancy periods and occupation arrangements.</p>

            <h3>2. Relief Entitlements Review</h3>

            <p>Verify current and potential relief entitlements across your portfolio:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small Business Rate Relief (SBRR):</strong> Properties with rateable values below the threshold (currently properties with RV under £15,000 in England)</li>
                <li><strong>Empty Property Relief:</strong> Initial 3-month exemption for most properties (verify remaining days)</li>
                <li><strong>RHL Relief:</strong> 40% relief for 2025/26 for eligible retail, hospitality, and leisure properties (capped at £110,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Charitable Relief:</strong> For properties occupied by registered charities</li>
                <li><strong>Rural Rate Relief:</strong> For eligible rural properties</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Rateable Value Verification</h3>

            <p>With the 2026 revaluation approaching, now is the time to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Review current rateable values through the VOA website</li>
                <li>Compare against similar properties in your area</li>
                <li>Identify potential grounds for challenging the April 2026 valuation</li>
                <li>Gather evidence of factors that might reduce value (disrepair, adverse location factors, market decline)</li>
                <li>Consider engaging a rating surveyor for professional assessment before the April 2026 deadline</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strategic Occupation Planning: The 13-Week Rule</h2>

            <p>One of the most significant changes affecting vacant property strategy is the <strong>13-week occupation requirement</strong> for resetting empty property relief, implemented from 1 April 2024. This rule replaced the previous 6-week threshold and fundamentally changed how landlords approach void management.</p>

            <h3>Understanding the 13-Week Reset Mechanism</h3>

            <p>To qualify for a fresh period of empty property relief after the initial exemption period expires, a property must be occupied for at least <strong>13 consecutive weeks (92 days)</strong>. This occupation must be genuine and beneficial, meeting the four legal tests of rateable occupation:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Actual occupation</strong> - physical presence and use of the property</li>
                <li><strong>Exclusive occupation</strong> - the occupier has exclusive possession</li>
                <li><strong>Beneficial occupation</strong> - the occupation provides benefit to the occupier</li>
                <li><strong>Not too transient</strong> - the occupation has sufficient permanence</li>
            </ol>

            <p>According to legal commentary from <strong>Kingsley Napley LLP</strong>, the government's intention with the 13-week rule was to prevent "box shifting" tactics where properties were briefly occupied purely to avoid rates. The extended period ensures more substantive use of vacant premises.</p>

            <h3>Year-End Occupation Opportunities</h3>

            <p>December 2025 presents a strategic opportunity for implementing compliant occupation arrangements:</p>

            <p><strong>Timeline Analysis:</strong> A property occupied from early December 2025 would complete the 13-week requirement by late February/early March 2026, qualifying for a fresh 3-month empty property relief period starting when the occupation ends. This positions the property optimally for the post-revaluation period.</p>

            <p><strong>Practical Implementation Options:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pop-up retail arrangements:</strong> Seasonal operators for Christmas trading (must extend beyond 13 weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>Short-term licenses:</strong> To businesses needing temporary space (minimum 13 weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>Technology-based beneficial occupation:</strong> Solutions like VacatAd's compliant occupancy model</li>
                <li><strong>Community or charitable use:</strong> Temporary occupation by qualifying organizations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>VacatAd's Compliant Solution: Technology-Driven Beneficial Occupation</h2>

            <p>VacatAd's model specifically addresses the challenges of the 13-week occupation requirement while providing genuine beneficial use of vacant properties. The approach involves:</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Plug-and-play technology requiring only a power source</li>
                <li><strong>Public Wi-Fi provision:</strong> Free internet access to the surrounding community</li>
                <li><strong>Local advertising platform:</strong> Support for local businesses through digital advertising</li>
                <li><strong>Security monitoring:</strong> Optional advanced surveillance and environmental sensors</li>
                <li><strong>Formal tenancy agreement:</strong> Exclusive, beneficial occupation meeting all legal criteria</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Compliance and Documentation</h3>

            <p>VacatAd's system provides comprehensive evidence of occupation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Wi-Fi usage logs demonstrating public benefit</li>
                <li>Continuous monitoring data</li>
                <li>Formal lease documentation</li>
                <li>Council liaison and notification management</li>
                <li>100% success rate across 250+ properties nationwide</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This evidence base is crucial as councils intensify scrutiny following the revaluation. As noted in the <strong>Spring Budget 2024 analysis by Kingsley Napley</strong>, arrangements purely designed to avoid rates without genuine occupation are increasingly challenged by local authorities.</p>

            <h2>Financial Projections: Calculating Potential Savings</h2>

            <p>Understanding the financial impact of different strategies is essential for year-end planning. Consider the following scenarios:</p>

            <h3>Scenario 1: No Action (Continued Empty Rates)</h3>

            <p>For a typical office property with rateable value of £50,000:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Standard multiplier 2025/26: 54.6p (estimated)</li>
                <li>Annual rates bill: £27,300</li>
                <li>Monthly empty rates cost: £2,275</li>
                <li><strong>Six-month void cost: £13,650</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 2: Beneficial Occupation Strategy</h3>

            <p>Same property with compliant 13-week occupation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Occupation period (13 weeks): Occupier liable for rates</li>
                <li>Fresh EPR period (3 months): £0 rates liability</li>
                <li>Net saving over 6-month period: <strong>£6,825</strong> (3 months relief)</li>
                <li>Additional savings: Property security, monitoring, community benefit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scenario 3: Multiple Reset Strategy</h3>

            <p>For properties with extended void periods, multiple compliant occupation cycles can be implemented:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>December-February: First 13-week occupation</li>
                <li>March-May: First EPR period (3 months)</li>
                <li>June-August: Second 13-week occupation</li>
                <li>September-November: Second EPR period (3 months)</li>
                <li><strong>Annual saving potential: 50%+ of empty rates</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Preparing for April 2026: Action Plan</h2>

            <p>To maximize relief and position your portfolio optimally for the new revaluation period, consider this timeline:</p>

            <h3>December 2025 (Immediate Actions)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Complete portfolio audit of all vacant properties</li>
                <li>Calculate remaining EPR days for each property</li>
                <li>Identify properties requiring occupation arrangements before April 2026</li>
                <li>Review current rateable values and prepare challenge evidence</li>
                <li>Contact VacatAd or other compliant solution providers to discuss options</li>
                <li>Implement occupation arrangements for properties with expired EPR</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>January-March 2026 (Pre-Revaluation Period)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Monitor Draft 2026 Rateable Value List (typically published by VOA)</li>
                <li>Complete ongoing 13-week occupation arrangements</li>
                <li>Prepare appeals for properties with excessive valuations</li>
                <li>Ensure all relief claims are properly documented and submitted</li>
                <li>Review and update property marketing strategies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>April 2026 Onwards (Post-Revaluation)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Review new rateable values immediately upon publication</li>
                <li>Submit challenges through VOA's Check-Challenge-Appeal process if appropriate</li>
                <li>Implement occupation cycles for properties with ongoing voids</li>
                <li>Monitor council billing to ensure correct relief application</li>
                <li>Plan mid-year review for Q3 2026</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Regulatory Compliance: Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h2>

            <p>The heightened scrutiny following revaluation means compliance is more critical than ever. Common pitfalls to avoid include:</p>

            <h3>1. Token or Sham Occupation</h3>

            <p>Following high-profile cases including the <strong>"snail farm" scandal</strong> reported in Westminster (where councils lost £370,000 to fraudulent agricultural exemption claims), authorities are vigilant against artificial occupation arrangements. Ensure any occupation arrangement:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Has genuine commercial or public benefit</li>
                <li>Involves real physical occupation</li>
                <li>Is properly documented with formal agreements</li>
                <li>Can withstand council investigation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Inadequate Documentation</h3>

            <p>Maintain comprehensive records including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dated tenancy or license agreements</li>
                <li>Evidence of beneficial use (usage logs, utility bills, access records)</li>
                <li>Communication with councils regarding occupation status</li>
                <li>Photographs or surveys documenting property condition</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Missed Deadlines</h3>

            <p>Critical dates to monitor:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 April 2026:</strong> New rateable values take effect</li>
                <li><strong>30 April 2026:</strong> Typical deadline for Check stage of appeals</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Notification requirements when properties become occupied/vacant</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Broader Context: Business Rates Reform Agenda</h2>

            <p>The April 2026 revaluation occurs within a broader context of business rates reform. The Labour government has committed to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Permanent lower multipliers</strong> for retail, hospitality, and leisure properties</li>
                <li><strong>Higher multipliers for large distribution warehouses</strong> (£500,000+ RV)</li>
                <li><strong>More frequent revaluations</strong> to keep values current</li>
                <li><strong>Digitalisation of the system</strong> for better data sharing</li>
                <li><strong>Potential General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR)</strong> for business rates</li>
            </ul>

            <p>According to a <strong>Tax Adviser Magazine article from October 2024</strong>, these reforms aim to "replace the current business rates system with something fairer," while maintaining revenue neutrality. For vacant property owners, this means continued pressure to optimize rates strategies within clearly defined legal boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Strategic Action Required</h2>

            <p>The convergence of the April 2026 revaluation, the 13-week occupation rule, and evolving relief schemes creates both challenges and opportunities for commercial property owners. Success in this environment requires:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Proactive planning</strong> - Don't wait until April; act now to optimize your position</li>
                <li><strong>Compliant strategies</strong> - Ensure all relief claims are legally sound and well-documented</li>
                <li><strong>Professional advice</strong> - Engage specialists in business rates and beneficial occupation</li>
                <li><strong>Technology adoption</strong> - Leverage modern solutions that provide genuine benefit while securing relief</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous monitoring</strong> - Stay informed of regulatory changes and revaluation impacts</li>
            </ol>

            <p>December 2025 represents a critical window for implementing strategic occupation arrangements that will carry properties through the revaluation period with minimized rates exposure. VacatAd's compliant, technology-driven approach offers a proven solution that aligns with regulatory requirements while delivering substantial financial benefits.</p>
