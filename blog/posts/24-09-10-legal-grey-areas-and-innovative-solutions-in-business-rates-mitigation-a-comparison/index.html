                    <div>A recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9904dz73pyo" target="_blank">BBC report </a>on a Liverpool office building turned snail farm has highlighted a controversial practice in business rates mitigation that is drawing scrutiny from both local authorities and legal experts. The case involves a company using an unconventional snail farming operation to claim agricultural exemptions on business rates, sparking a debate over the legality and ethics of such schemes. As businesses look for ways to reduce their financial burdens, it&rsquo;s important to differentiate between legitimate solutions like Vacatad's technology-first approach and questionable tactics that could lead to legal complications.<h2>The Snail Farm Controversy: A Case of Tax Avoidance?</h2><p class="">The situation in Liverpool revolves around 15 crates of snails, each containing as few as two snails, being stored in an office building. The company involved, Snai1 Primary Products 2023 Ltd, claims that this constitutes a legitimate agricultural operation, which could exempt the property from business rates. However, this tactic has raised suspicions among local authorities, who view it as a potential scheme for tax avoidance rather than a bona fide business activity BBC News.</p><p class="">The legality of such operations hinges on whether the use of the property can genuinely be classified as agricultural. In the UK, agricultural land and buildings are generally exempt from business rates under the Local Government Finance Act 1988. However, the courts have previously ruled against similar schemes. In 2021, the High Court deemed a snail farm tenancy deal involving the same individuals as a "sham," specifically designed to avoid paying business rates BBC News.</p><h2>Understanding the Legal Landscape: Agriculture and Marketing Properties</h2><p class="">Under UK law, properties used for agricultural purposes are indeed eligible for business rates relief. However, the definition of "agricultural use" is strict, and any attempt to exploit this for purposes that do not genuinely align with agricultural activities can be legally challenged. The courts have consistently ruled against schemes where the primary intent is to avoid business rates rather than engage in legitimate farming.</p><p class="">The use of properties for marketing purposes&mdash;such as displaying adverts or temporary occupations&mdash;does not typically qualify for agricultural exemptions. This is because marketing does not meet the statutory definition of agricultural use, which generally involves the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals in sufficient quantities to constitute a business.</p><h2>How Vacatad&rsquo;s Approach Differs</h2><p class="">In stark contrast to the questionable practices seen in the Liverpool snail farm case, Vacatad offers a technology-first, legally sound solution for business rates mitigation. Unlike schemes that rely on tenuous claims of agricultural use, Vacatad focuses on providing genuine occupancy solutions that align with both the letter and the spirit of the law.</p><p class=""><strong>1. Beneficial Occupation</strong>: Vacatad temporarily occupies vacant commercial properties using advanced technology to create public Wi-Fi networks and advertising spaces. This occupation qualifies the property for business rates relief under "beneficial occupation" status&mdash;a legally recognised and court-backed method that ensures compliance with all regulations.</p><p class=""><strong>2. Transparency and Compliance</strong>: Vacatad&rsquo;s operations are fully transparent and designed to withstand scrutiny. The company takes charge of all interactions with local authorities, ensuring that all processes are compliant with the latest legal requirements. This is in stark contrast to the practices of companies like Snai1 Primary Products, where the primary goal appears to be avoiding rates through dubious means.</p><p class=""><strong>3. Community Engagement</strong>: Vacatad&rsquo;s model also benefits the local community by providing free internet access and supporting small businesses through targeted advertising. This dual impact not only makes a positive contribution to the local economy but also provides a tangible, lawful use of the property, reinforcing its legitimacy.</p><h2>Conclusion: Choosing the Right Path in Business Rates Mitigation</h2><p class="">As local authorities increase their scrutiny of business rates mitigation schemes, it&rsquo;s crucial for property owners and businesses to choose solutions that are both effective and legally sound. The case of the Liverpool snail farm serves as a cautionary tale of what can happen when companies attempt to exploit legal grey areas for tax avoidance.</p><p class="">Vacatad offers a robust alternative that not only helps businesses save on rates but also adheres to all legal requirements, ensuring peace of mind for property owners. By focusing on beneficial occupation and community engagement, Vacatad demonstrates that it is possible to achieve significant savings without resorting to questionable practices.</p><p class="">For businesses looking to mitigate business rates legally and ethically, Vacatad is the clear choice. </p></div><div>Speak to the team today</div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="600px" src="https://vacatad.pipedrive.com/scheduler/2rdW57uq/vacatad-introductory-call" title="Pipedrive Scheduler Embed" width="100%"></iframe>
