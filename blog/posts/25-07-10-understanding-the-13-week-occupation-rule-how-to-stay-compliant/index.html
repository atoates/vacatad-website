                    <p class="lead">Following the government's reform to the Empty Property Relief reset period, landlords must now ensure that any reoccupation lasts for a full 13 weeks before a new relief period can be claimed. The change, effective from April 2024, was designed to discourage short-term avoidance tactics — but it also introduced new administrative and legal challenges for property owners.</p>

                    <p>Following the government's reform to the Empty Property Relief (EPR) reset period, landlords must now ensure that any reoccupation lasts for a <strong>full 13 weeks</strong> before a new relief period can be claimed. The change, effective from April 2024, was designed to discourage short-term avoidance tactics &mdash; but it also introduced new administrative and legal challenges for property owners.</p>
<h2>What changed &mdash; and why it matters</h2>
<p>Previously, the rule required only <strong>six weeks of occupation</strong> to restart the relief period. That meant some property owners could use very brief tenancies or temporary storage to reset the exemption clock. However, recent reforms &mdash; and reinforced case law &mdash; have extended the timeframe to ensure genuine, sustained occupation.</p>
<p>If a landlord fails to meet this threshold, they risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Losing entitlement</strong> to a fresh relief period.</li>
<li><strong>Facing retrospective rates demands</strong> for the supposed "occupied" period.</li>
<li><strong>Potential reputational or legal exposure</strong> if an arrangement is deemed contrived.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Critical Change:</strong> The extension from 6 to 13 weeks represents more than double the previous requirement. This significantly impacts how landlords must plan their occupation strategies.</p>
</div>

<h2>Beneficial occupation and the 13-week threshold</h2>
<p>Courts continue to define <strong>beneficial occupation</strong> as one that is genuine, beneficial, and non-transient. The 13-week rule directly supports that principle. To qualify, landlords must demonstrate not only that the property was used &mdash; but that it was used <strong>meaningfully and continuously</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where technology-based models like VacatAd's come into their own. With continuous connectivity and monitored occupancy, they provide irrefutable proof of real occupation over time.</p>
<h2>Evidence that stands up to challenge</h2>
<p>When applying for or defending rates relief, property owners must be able to produce:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A valid lease or licence</strong> for the occupation period.</li>
<li><strong>Records of activity</strong> (e.g., Wi-Fi usage, maintenance logs, photos).</li>
<li><strong>Proof of benefit or service delivered</strong> (e.g., local advertising, connectivity reports).</li>
</ol>
<p>VacatAd's automated reporting system compiles this evidence effortlessly &mdash; generating <strong>timestamped occupancy data</strong> throughout the 13-week period.</p>

<h2>Avoiding the pitfalls</h2>
<p>The new 13-week rule has caught out many landlords who assumed old practices would suffice. Common mistakes include:</p>
<h3>Short-term licences that fail to meet the 13-week requirement</h3>
<p>Some landlords still attempt 6 or 8-week arrangements, not realising the threshold has changed. These arrangements are now automatically non-compliant.</p>
<h3>Nominal use without measurable activity</h3>
<p>Simply having a lease agreement isn't enough. Local authorities increasingly request evidence of actual use &mdash; Wi-Fi logs, utility records, or access data.</p>
<h3>Lack of records proving continuous use</h3>
<p>Even legitimate occupation can be challenged if you cannot demonstrate that it lasted the full period. Gaps in evidence can be fatal to a claim.</p>
<h3>Failure to vacate properly before claiming renewed relief</h3>
<p>The property must genuinely become vacant again before a new relief period begins. Authorities are scrutinising whether "vacant" periods are genuine.</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>VacatAd Solution:</strong> By contrast, a VacatAd installation ensures that every week of occupation is verified, recorded, and fully compliant &mdash; with automated documentation ready for any authority query.</p>
</div>
<h2>The VacatAd advantage</h2>
<p>VacatAd's technology platform is specifically designed to address the challenges of the 13-week rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic compliance:</strong> Continuous operation and reporting over the full 13 weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Zero disruption:</strong> No need for structural changes or sub-letting.</li>
<li><strong>Community goodwill:</strong> Public Wi-Fi and local advertising generate real economic benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio management:</strong> Dashboards track multiple properties and relief periods at once.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real-time monitoring</h3>
<p>Every VacatAd installation generates continuous data streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi connection logs (updated every 15 minutes)</li>
<li>Device uptime and network health metrics</li>
<li>Advertising impression counts for local businesses</li>
<li>System health and maintenance alerts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automated documentation</h3>
<p>At the end of the 13-week period, landlords receive comprehensive reports showing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total days of active occupation</li>
<li>Network uptime percentage</li>
<li>User engagement statistics</li>
<li>Community benefit metrics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategic value for landlords</h2>
<p>Compliance is only part of the story. By adopting a system that provides proof of beneficial occupation, landlords can approach local authorities <strong>proactively</strong> &mdash; avoiding disputes and delays.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ongoing digital engagement offers insight into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property performance:</strong> Understanding foot traffic and local engagement patterns</li>
<li><strong>Community reach:</strong> Demonstrating social value for ESG reporting</li>
<li><strong>Market intelligence:</strong> Data on local area usage can inform future leasing strategies</li>
<li><strong>Corporate reporting:</strong> Quantifiable community benefit metrics for stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planning your 13-week strategy</h2>
<p>To successfully navigate the 13-week rule, property owners should:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Calendar management:</strong> Track when relief periods expire and when occupation must begin</li>
<li><strong>Installation timing:</strong> Allow time for setup before the relief period ends</li>
<li><strong>Documentation protocols:</strong> Establish clear record-keeping from day one</li>
<li><strong>Authority communication:</strong> Be prepared to demonstrate compliance proactively</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio coordination:</strong> Stagger occupation periods across multiple properties for efficient management</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>Best Practice Tip</h3>
<p>Start your occupation period at least two weeks before your initial relief expires. This buffer ensures you can claim the maximum new relief period while accounting for any installation or setup time.</p>
</div>
<h2>What happens if you get it wrong?</h2>
<p>The consequences of non-compliance can be significant:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backdated rates:</strong> Full rates liability for periods incorrectly claimed as occupied</li>
<li><strong>Interest charges:</strong> Additional costs on late payments</li>
<li><strong>Future scrutiny:</strong> Increased monitoring of subsequent claims</li>
<li><strong>Legal costs:</strong> Potential tribunal expenses if disputes arise</li>
<li><strong>Reputational damage:</strong> Being flagged as a non-compliant landlord</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 13-week rule has changed how rates mitigation must be approached &mdash; but it hasn't eliminated opportunity. With VacatAd's technology-first system, landlords can satisfy legal definitions of occupation while maintaining operational efficiency and community contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Compliant, transparent, and verifiable:</strong> this is what modern rates mitigation looks like in 2025.</p>
