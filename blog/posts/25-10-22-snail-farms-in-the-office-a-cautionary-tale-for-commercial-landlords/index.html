                    <p class="lead">Crates of snails in a vacant London office – part of a tax avoidance scheme that claimed an agricultural exemption on business rates.</p>

                    <p><em>Crates of snails in a vacant London office – part of a tax avoidance scheme that claimed an agricultural exemption on business rates</em><a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=Image" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);"><em>[1]</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The commercial property world recently buzzed with an almost unbelievable story: a landlord using <strong>snail farming</strong> as a way to avoid business rates. Yes – <em>live snails in empty offices</em>. This viral saga, centred on an eccentric operator named Terry Ball, highlighted how far some will go to dodge empty property taxes. Ball’s scheme was simple: set up snail “farms” in vacant offices, claim the building is a farm (snails qualify as livestock), and thereby <strong>avoid paying business rates</strong> on the empty space<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=several%20hours%20about%20how%20he,millions%20of%20pounds%20in%20taxes" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[2]</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/04/the-long-read-snail-farm-tax-avoidance-scheme-terry-ball#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20small%20print,potentially%20exempt%20from%20business%20rates" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[3]</a>. The loophole exists because under UK law, breeding land snails for food counts as an agricultural <em>fish farm</em> use exempt from business rates<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/04/the-long-read-snail-farm-tax-avoidance-scheme-terry-ball#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20small%20print,potentially%20exempt%20from%20business%20rates" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[3]</a>. It sounds like a joke, but it’s very real – and it <strong>ended up making headlines</strong> in the worst way for those involved.</p><h2>The Terry Ball Snail Farm Saga – Summary and Updates</h2><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579470785623-3d2c229f4fc6?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3w4NDAxNjh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHxzbmFpbCUyMHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NjUwODYzMTN8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080"></p><p>Dubbed <em>“London’s leading snail farmer”</em> in one investigation, 79-year-old Ball turned vacant offices into makeshift snail breeding sites<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=The%20farmer%2C%20a%2079,millions%20of%20pounds%20in%20taxes" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[4]</a>. He installed crates of live snails in at least four London buildings, each held by a shell company on a short lease, to claim an agricultural rates exemption<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=several%20hours%20about%20how%20he,millions%20of%20pounds%20in%20taxes" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[2]</a><a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=All%20of%20the%20snails%20inside,order%20to%20enable%20tax%20avoidance" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[5]</a>. In one central London property (Winchester House on Old Marylebone Road), multiple floors were filled with snail crates – and Westminster City Council later discovered the ruse, finding <em>“boxes of snails”</em> on site<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=His%20method%20is%20simple,therefore%20exempt%20from%20paying%20taxes" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[6]</a>. The council leader, Adam Hug, called the situation <em>“a ludicrous notion”</em> – yet it had been costing his council a lot of money<a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=Recently%2C%20council%20officers%20discovered%20crates,based%20on%20a%20ludicrous%20notion" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[7]</a>. In fact, Westminster Council estimates it lost about <strong>£370,000</strong> in business rates revenue due to these snail farm schemes, and it has already wound up four of Ball’s dummy companies for non-payment of rates<a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=Recently%2C%20council%20officers%20discovered%20crates,based%20on%20a%20ludicrous%20notion" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[8]</a>. Ball’s response? He crowed that he was merely exploiting the rules, and even bragged about the snail story’s fame after it <strong>went viral internationally</strong><a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/the-omaze-mansion-tax-and-other-stories#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAre%20you%20trying%20to%20make,he%20picked%20up%20the%20phone" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[9]</a>. (It was reportedly a <em>“massive story in France”</em>, proving that snail-related news does travel fast!).</p><p>The fallout from the <strong>“snail farmer” case</strong> has extended beyond tabloid curiosity. Just weeks after the story broke, an MP read details of the scheme in the House of Commons during a budget debate<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/the-omaze-mansion-tax-and-other-stories#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20news%20outlets,in%20the%20House%20of%20Commons" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[10]</a>. London’s City Hall also took notice – the London Assembly unanimously passed a motion urging action against such tactics, warning that <em>“business rates avoidance schemes like bogus snail farms…drain millions from vital services and undermine honest businesses”</em><a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/the-omaze-mansion-tax-and-other-stories#:~:text=The%20London%20Assembly%20has%20also,services%20and%20undermine%20honest%20businesses%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[11]</a>. In other words, what started as one man’s quirky tax dodge has put a spotlight on <strong>aggressive rates avoidance</strong> across the country. And that spotlight isn’t flattering for landlords caught up in similar tricks.</p><h2>Reputational Risk: Gimmicky Schemes Can Haunt You</h2><p>While avoiding a hefty business rates bill is tempting, <strong>“too clever” avoidance schemes come with a serious reputational cost</strong>. The snail-farm ploy has made councils and the public understandably cynical about any unusual rates mitigation. A landlord who tries something outlandish risks being <strong>labelled unscrupulous</strong> and even being named-and-shamed in the media. In Westminster’s case, the council explicitly said building owners were <em>complicit</em> in these arrangements<a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=The%20Council%20is%20adamant%20that,or%20heliculture%20to%20mitigate%20costs" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[12]</a>. The council leader went on record condemning <em>“unscrupulous traders”</em> hopping between loopholes and urged the government to stamp out such tactics<a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=The%20Council%20is%20adamant%20that,or%20heliculture%20to%20mitigate%20costs" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[12]</a>. For a respectable commercial landlord or agent, being painted with that brush – or having your property linked to an absurd snail farm story – is a PR nightmare.</p><p>Remember, the property industry runs on relationships and trust. Local authorities, future tenants, and investors all take note of a landlord’s reputation. Getting caught in a dubious scheme can <strong>undermine credibility</strong> with councils and lead to harsher scrutiny on your other properties. As one industry observer noted, stunts like snail farms or fake “pop-up” charities erode the goodwill that honest landlords rely on<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/the-omaze-mansion-tax-and-other-stories#:~:text=The%20London%20Assembly%20has%20also,services%20and%20undermine%20honest%20businesses%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[11]</a>. In practical terms, if you ever genuinely need to claim relief or work with a council on a project, you don’t want them remembering you as <em>“the one with the snails.”</em></p><p>Moreover, these stories live on the internet forever. A quick Google search of your building could turn up headlines about molluscs in the boardroom. That’s not exactly the legacy most property professionals want. <strong>In short: gimmicks might save a bit of money today, but they can cost you your good name tomorrow.</strong></p><h2>Financial Pitfalls: When Avoidance Backfires</h2><p>Embarrassment isn’t the only risk. Schemes like the snail farms can <strong>fall apart legally</strong>, leaving landlords worse off than if they’d just paid the rates or found a legitimate solution. Councils are increasingly cracking down: if they successfully prove an “occupation” is a sham, the rates bill lands back at the landlord’s feet – often with interest, penalties or legal costs on top<a href="https://www.gumersalls.co.uk/why-are-solicitors-dealing-with-offices-filled-with-snails/#:~:text=itself%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9CCanceller%20of,the%20Exchequer%E2%80%9D%20on%20its%20website" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[13]</a>. Case law is littered with cautionary tales. For example, in 2021 a landlord in Leeds tried a snail farm tenancy trick and ended up in court. The High Court (and later the Court of Appeal) ruled the arrangement was a <em>sham</em>, voiding the rates relief. The result? The landlord had to cough up nearly <strong>£40,000</strong> in backdated business rates and legal costs<a href="https://www.gumersalls.co.uk/why-are-solicitors-dealing-with-offices-filled-with-snails/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20case%20in,contracts%20described%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Csham%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[14]</a>. In another case in Kirklees, a council won £16,000 in costs after prosecuting a snail farming tax dodge<a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=,upheld%20the%20High%20Court%20ruling" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[15]</a>. These sums far outweigh the short-term savings the schemes promised.</p><p>Even if you <em>technically</em> stay within the law, councils can play hardball. Westminster and other councils have shown willingness to <strong>liquidate shell companies</strong> and pursue landlords through the courts to recover lost revenue<a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/terry-ball-the-snail-farmer-his-mafia#:~:text=for%20%C2%A335%20a%20go,snail%20farms%20in%20Winchester%20House" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[16]</a><a href="https://www.rossmartin.co.uk/sme-tax-news/8678-councils-step-on-snail-tax-scammers#:~:text=Relief%20from%20business%20rates%20is,payment%20of%20business%20rates" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[17]</a>. Legal battles are expensive and time-consuming, not to mention stressful. And if a court decides your fancy avoidance arrangement was not genuine, you’ll be liable for all those rates you tried to skip. In other words, a dodgy scheme can <strong>hurt your wallet twice</strong> – once in paying the advisor or setup costs, and again when you’re forced to pay the original bill (plus extra).</p><p>The bottom line: if an avoidance strategy sounds too good (or too absurd) to be true, it probably is. <strong>Don’t gamble your real savings on a loophole that could slam shut without warning.</strong></p><h2>A Smarter Solution: Transparent, Legal Relief through Beneficial Occupation</h2><p>So what’s the alternative? Fortunately, landlords can reduce their empty property rates <strong>without resorting to snail antics or other gimmicks</strong>. This is where <strong>VacatAd’s fully legal, transparent, tech-driven beneficial occupation model</strong> comes in. VacatAd was created to give property owners a way to cut business rates on vacant units by <em>working with</em> the system, not against it. Instead of hiding crates of molluscs in the dark, VacatAd uses technology to create a <em>genuine but low-impact occupancy</em> in your space – one that satisfies rating authorities and even provides a small public benefit.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong> VacatAd installs a secure, plug-and-play device (requiring only a power outlet) in your vacant property. This device provides <strong>free public Wi-Fi</strong> to the surrounding area and doubles as a platform for local community advertising. In doing so, your empty shop or office unit is no longer “empty” – it’s legitimately occupied by a mini community hub. The occupation is real (people can use the Wi-Fi and see the local ads), but it’s <strong>non-intrusive and compliant</strong> with all regulations. Importantly, it aligns with the exact legal criteria for beneficial occupation, meaning you qualify for empty rates relief <strong>fully within the law</strong>. There’s no shell game needed; it’s straightforward and <strong>transparent</strong>. In fact, VacatAd’s approach is <em>welcomed</em> by many councils because it actually adds a modest public service (connectivity and support for local businesses) rather than just exploiting a loophole.</p><p>From a landlord’s perspective, this tech-driven solution is light-years away from the snail scheme. It doesn’t impede your plans – the equipment is small and can be installed in under an hour, with no alterations to the property structure. You get <strong>continuous monitoring and documented proof of occupation</strong> (so if the council ever inquires, you have solid evidence to back up your relief claim)<a href="https://vacatad.com/#:~:text=Compliance%20Evidence" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[22]</a>. VacatAd handles all the compliance paperwork and liaises with authorities as needed, ensuring everything is above board. And because the model is <strong>fully transparent</strong>, it’s trusted by stakeholders: VacatAd has a 100% success rate in securing relief across 250+ properties, with an approach <em>“trusted nationwide by landlords and councils alike”</em><a href="https://vacatad.com/#:~:text=Trusted%20nationwide%20by%20landlords%20and,%E2%80%94%20fast%2C%20legal%2C%20and%20effortless" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(21, 96, 130);">[23]</a>. In short, it’s a solution that protects your pocket <strong>and</strong> your professionalism.</p><h2>Keep Your Credibility – No Snails Required</h2><p><strong>The key takeaway for landlords and agents:</strong> Don’t get caught up in gimmicks that risk your credibility and your savings. The tale of <em>“Terry the snail farmer”</em> might be amusing in hindsight, but for any landlord involved it has been an object lesson in public embarrassment and legal peril. Schemes that skirt the line – be it snail farms, sham charities, or other creative dodges – are ticking time bombs. They can blow up your reputation, invite intense scrutiny, and potentially leave you footing an even larger bill.</p><p>Instead, focus on <strong>legitimate, sustainable strategies</strong> for business rates mitigation. With innovative options like VacatAd’s beneficial occupation model available, there’s simply no need to play hide-and-seek with the authorities. You can achieve substantial savings <strong>legally</strong> while actually doing something positive (however small) for the community and keeping your good name intact. Remember that councils are on high alert now; a scheme that might have slipped by in the past could be the next viral cautionary story. As prudent property professionals, the goal should be to minimise costs <em>and</em> risk – not to win the prize for most bizarre tax dodge.</p><p><strong>Don’t let a pursuit of short-term savings jeopardise your long-term reputation or investment.</strong> The smart move is to stay on the right side of the law with solutions designed for compliance from day one.</p><h3>Speak to a VacatAd Expert</h3><p>If you’re looking to reduce your empty property business rates <strong>without the drama</strong>, it’s time to explore a better way.
