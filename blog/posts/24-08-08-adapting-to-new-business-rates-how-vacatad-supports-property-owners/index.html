A recent update from the government consultation on "<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/business-rates-avoidance-and-evasion-consultation" target="_blank">Business Rates Avoidance and Evasion</a>" sheds light on significant changes that will impact strategies for managing business rates on empty properties. This blog post delves into the consultation's findings and outlines how Vacatad's innovative approach remains aligned with these changes, ensuring property owners can navigate the new system effectively.</p></div><img alt="Business rates consultation and regulatory changes" class="article-image" height="600" loading="lazy" src="posts/24-08-08-adapting-to-new-business-rates-how-vacatad-supports-property-owners/image2.webp" width="800"/><div><strong>Understanding the Changes to Empty Property Relief</strong><p class="">The government's consultation, concluded in March 2024, has introduced pivotal adjustments aimed at curtailing avoidance practices surrounding Empty Property Relief (EPR). The consultation's outcomes highlight an extension of the EPR "reset period" from six weeks to thirteen weeks, starting from 1 April 2024. This modification is designed to discourage the so-called "box shifting" &ndash; a manoeuvre where properties are temporarily occupied to reset the EPR and minimise business rates on vacant property.</p><p class="">Moreover, the government is contemplating the introduction of a General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) for business rates.
