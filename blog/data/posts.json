    "content": "<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p><strong>In a nutshell:</strong> The UK government is implementing major reforms to the business rates system over the next few years. These changes aim to create a fairer, more modern business rates system that protects high street businesses and ensures large properties pay their share. In this article, we break down the key updates from the Business Rates: Forward Look policy paper (updated September 2025) and explain what they mean for you as a business ratepayer. From new permanent reliefs for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses to the upcoming 2026 revaluation and ongoing reforms, here's everything you need to know.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Permanent Relief for High Street Businesses (from 2026)</h2>\n<p>One of the headline changes is a new permanent business rates relief for Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (RHL) properties with rateable values under &pound;500,000. Starting April 2026, these properties will benefit from two new lower tax \"multipliers\" (rates), replacing the temporary RHL discounts that had to be renewed annually. In other words, small and mid-sized shops, pubs, restaurants, hotels and similar properties will pay lower business rates long-term &ndash; a move designed to give certainty and support to the high street.</p>\n<img alt=\"Busy UK high street of small shops showing growth for retail businesses\" class=\"image-inline article-image\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-10-02-business-rates-forward-look-what-the-latest-updates-mean-for-your-business/image2.webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<h3>Why this matters</h3>\n<p>Previously, RHL businesses received short-term reliefs (often a percentage discount with a cap) that were announced year-to-year. This created uncertainty and a \"cliff-edge\" each year when the relief could end. By legislating a permanently lower rate, the government is ensuring ongoing tax relief for high-street businesses without annual renewals. There will be no overall cap on this relief &ndash; all qualifying properties can benefit fully (unlike past schemes that capped the total relief a business could claim).</p>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>Under the new structure, if you own an RHL property with a rateable value below &pound;500k, you'll fall into one of two preferential categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A small business RHL multiplier for properties with RV below &pound;51,000, and</li>\n<li>A standard RHL multiplier for properties with RV &pound;51,000 to &pound;499,999.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two tiers mirror the existing small business vs. standard thresholds, but apply only to RHL-use properties. The exact reduced rates (pence in the pound) for these multipliers will be set in the Autumn 2025 Budget, but legislation has indicated they could be up to 20p lower than the normal rate. In practice, that's up to a ~40% tax reduction for eligible businesses.</p>\n<h3>Eligibility</h3>\n<p>To qualify, a property must be occupied and used wholly or mainly for retail, hospitality, or leisure purposes, and open to the public (e.g. shops, restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels). The vast majority of high street consumer-facing businesses will meet these criteria. Notably, making this relief part of the tax system (via a lower multiplier) means it's automatically applied to all qualifying properties without needing a special application each year.</p>\n<p>This permanent RHL relief delivers on the government's promise to \"support the high street with permanent cuts to business rates\". For many small businesses, it could mean substantial savings on their rates bills from 2026 onward. It also helps level the playing field between brick-and-mortar shops and large online retailers (who typically occupy massive warehouses rather than high street premises).</p>\n<h2>New \"High-Value\" Rate for Large Properties</h2>\n<p>To fund the high street relief in a revenue-neutral way, the government will introduce a new higher business rates multiplier for \"high-value\" properties &ndash; those with a rateable value &pound;500,000 or above. From April 2026, any property (of any sector) above this &pound;500k RV threshold will pay a higher tax rate on its occupier's bill, compared to the standard rate.</p>\n<img alt=\"Large UK distribution warehouse with delivery lorries representing high-value properties\" class=\"image-inline article-image\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-10-02-business-rates-forward-look-what-the-latest-updates-mean-for-your-business/image3.webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<h3>Who is affected</h3>\n<p>This change targets a small number of properties at the top end of the value scale &ndash; less than 1% of all properties &ndash; but importantly, it \"captures the majority of large distribution warehouses, including those used by online giants.\" In other words, mega-warehouses and fulfillment centers of online retailers (think large e-commerce companies) will fall into this high-value category. Many large format stores, supermarkets, or big hotel complexes could also have RVs over &pound;500k, meaning some big high street names will be impacted as well.</p>\n<h3>How much higher</h3>\n<p>The Non-Domestic Rating Act 2025 (more on this below) imposes a safeguard that the high-value multiplier can be at most +10 pence above the standard rate. This is a legal cap to prevent an excessive gap. The actual differential will be determined in the Budget, but expect a modest increase. For example, if the standard multiplier were around 50p, the high-value multiplier might be up to 60p (just illustrative). The intent is that large, profitable sites pay a slightly larger share of the tax, helping fund the relief for smaller businesses.</p>\n<h3>Rationale</h3>\n<p>This move is explicitly aimed at \"levelling the playing field between the high street and online giants\" by ensuring warehouses and very large properties (often benefiting from economies of scale or online sales) contribute more fairly. It's a shift towards a more progressive system: smaller properties get a tax cut, while the largest properties see a tax rise. For big operators, this means higher rates bills from 2026 &ndash; something to factor into budgets and perhaps an incentive to review your property portfolio strategy. For example, large retailers with many mid-sized stores under &pound;500k RV could gain in some sites but pay more on any flagship sites over &pound;500k.</p>\n<p>Importantly, all other properties (non-RHL under &pound;500k) will continue to use the existing \"small\" or \"standard\" multipliers as appropriate. Only the RHL sector gets the special lower rates under &pound;500k, and only &pound;500k+ properties get the special high-value rate. This creates a tiered system of five multipliers from 2026 onward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small business RHL multiplier (RHL properties &lt; &pound;51k RV) &ndash; lowest rate</li>\n<li>Standard RHL multiplier (RHL properties &pound;51k&ndash;&pound;499,999 RV)</li>\n<li>Small business multiplier (non-RHL properties &lt; &pound;51k RV)</li>\n<li>Standard multiplier (non-RHL properties &pound;51k&ndash;&pound;499,999 RV)</li>\n<li>High-value multiplier (all sectors &ge; &pound;500k RV) &ndash; highest rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(The specific rates for each will be announced in late 2025, closer to implementation.)</p>\n<h2>Legislative Framework and Safeguards</h2>\n<p>To enact these changes, the government passed the Non-Domestic Rating (Multipliers and Private Schools) Act 2025, which received Royal Assent on 3 April 2025. This legislation provides the legal basis for the new multipliers and also sets some important guardrails on how they can be applied:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The High-Value multiplier rate cannot exceed the Standard multiplier by more than 10 pence. This ensures the premium on large properties remains within reasonable bounds.</li>\n<li>The RHL multipliers (both small and standard RHL) cannot be more than 20 pence lower than the Small Business multiplier. In other words, the tax cut for RHL properties is capped at 20p below what other businesses of similar size pay. This roughly equates to a maximum ~40% discount for RHL businesses, preventing an overly deep subsidy and maintaining fairness across the tax base.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These maximum and minimum limits are not the actual intended rates &ndash; they are simply leeway for the Treasury when setting the precise numbers. The guardrails are there to reassure stakeholders that, for instance, the high-value rate won't be dramatically higher than the norm, and the RHL rates won't undercut the base rate by more than a certain amount.</p>\n<h3>Stakeholder input</h3>\n<p>Tax rates (multipliers) are typically set by government without formal consultation. However, given the significance of these changes, officials have indicated that businesses and industry groups are welcome to submit representations ahead of the Autumn 2025 Budget if they have views on the new rates. This provides an opportunity for sectors to voice concerns &ndash; for example, large retail chains might lobby for a minimal high-value premium, while small business groups might argue for the full 20p RHL discount. Engaging in this process could be worthwhile if your business will be significantly affected.</p>\n<p>(Note: The Act's title also references \"Private Schools\" &ndash; indeed, it included separate provisions to remove certain tax exemptions for private schools. While outside the scope of this article, it's another change in the drive for fairness.)</p>\n<h2>The 2026 Revaluation and Transitional Relief</h2>\n<p>All of the above changes will coincide with a regularly scheduled business rates revaluation in England, effective 1 April 2026. Revaluations occur every three years and update the rateable values (RVs) of properties to reflect more current market rents and conditions. The 2026 revaluation will use property values as of April 2024 as its baseline.</p>\n<h3>What to expect</h3>\n<p>Revaluation redistributes the total rates burden based on changes in relative property values &ndash; it \"maintains fairness in the system by redistributing liabilities\" and is not intended to raise extra revenue overall. In practice, some sectors or locations that saw big rental growth may find their RVs (and thus bills) increase, while others where values stagnated or fell could see reductions. For example, if warehouse rents rose faster than high street shop rents from 2021-2024, warehouses' RVs might jump in 2026 while shops might increase modestly or even decrease. This realignment is on top of the new multiplier structure &ndash; meaning 2026 will bring a double whammy of changes to rate bills.</p>\n<h3>Transitional relief</h3>\n<p>The government has signaled it will support ratepayers facing large bill increases due to revaluation by introducing a Transitional Relief scheme. Transitional relief typically phases in increases over a few years, capping how much a bill can rise annually. We won't know details until the Budget (scheduled for 26 November 2025), but businesses that see a big jump in RV should get some cushioning in 2026-27 and beyond. Keep in mind: if your RV drops in 2026, you'll benefit immediately from a lower bill (downward transitions were abolished for the 2023 revaluation in England, and it's likely 2026 will similarly allow instant decreases while phasing in increases).</p>\n<h3>Key dates</h3>\n<p>By the end of 2025, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is expected to publish draft 2026 rateable values for all properties, so you can check your new RV in advance. The Autumn Budget 2025 will confirm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The exact multipliers for 2026/27 (standard, small, RHL, high-value, etc.), and</li>\n<li>Details of the transitional relief scheme and any other support measures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Final new bills will be issued before April 2026 based on the new values and rates. The final 2026 rating list takes effect on 1 April 2026.</p>\n<h3>What you should do now</h3>\n<p>Review your current rateable values and get a sense of how the 2024 property market values (the revaluation baseline) compare for your sector. If you suspect your new RV is going to be significantly higher than currently, prepare for an increase (though transitional caps may soften it). Conversely, if your sector has struggled (e.g. some retail locations), you might anticipate an RV decrease &ndash; ensure you're not overpaying once the new list comes out. It may be wise to consult a rating advisor to estimate your 2026 RV and identify any grounds for appeal or reliefs.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing Reforms: Transforming Business Rates Initiative</h2>\n<p>Beyond the specific measures already decided for 2026, the government has a broader agenda to modernise the business rates system. At the Autumn 2024 Budget, alongside announcing the above changes, HM Treasury launched a discussion paper titled \"Transforming Business Rates\" that opened the door to more sweeping reforms. The aim is to address longstanding criticisms and ensure the system is \"fit for the 21st century\".</p>\n<h3>Stakeholder engagement</h3>\n<p>The response has been significant. In the first half of 2025, over 250 stakeholders representing 230 organizations participated in roundtable discussions, and more than 140 written submissions were received by the Treasury. This extensive feedback has been compiled into an Interim Report (published 11 September 2025) which summarizes industry views and outlines priority areas for reform the government is considering.</p>\n<h3>Areas of interest</h3>\n<p>While the full list is lengthy, some key themes on the table include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Moving to a \"slab\" or \"slice\" system</strong> &ndash; i.e. introducing more bands or progressive rates so that properties with higher values pay proportionately more (beyond just the single &pound;500k high-value band).</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewing Improvement Relief</strong> &ndash; ensuring businesses aren't disincentivized from upgrading their properties due to immediate RV increases (so that investing in property improvements is encouraged, not penalized).</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening anti-avoidance measures</strong> &ndash; giving authorities tools to crack down on avoidance tactics (for example, periodic short-term occupancy to evade empty property rates).</li>\n<li><strong>Re-examining Empty Property Relief</strong> &ndash; the rules and relief for vacant properties, to strike a balance between encouraging property use and not overburdening owners of unoccupied sites.</li>\n<li><strong>Digitalising and streamlining the rates system</strong> &ndash; including new compliance obligations such as the upcoming \"duty to notify\" changes to the VOA and annual return requirements, aimed at keeping the rating list up-to-date in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Timeline for reform</h3>\n<p>The government views business rates reform as a multi-year journey. According to the Forward Look, any further changes will be phased in over the course of this Parliament (likely through 2026&ndash;2029). We can expect an update on the next steps in the Autumn Budget 2025, and potentially new pilot programs or targeted changes in the following years. Crucially, there is no plan to scrap business rates entirely in favor of a new system (such as a land value tax) at this stage &ndash; the focus is on incremental improvements to the existing framework.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that more changes are coming, but gradually. By engaging with the process now (as many have), businesses can help shape a fairer system. And as reforms roll out, staying informed will be key to taking advantage of new reliefs or navigating new rules.</p>\n<h2>Timeline of Key Dates and Milestones</h2>\n<p>To recap, here are the key milestones in the business rates reform timetable that businesses should mark on their calendars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autumn Budget 2024 (Oct 2024):</strong> Announced intention for new RHL and high-value multipliers; \"Transforming Business Rates\" discussion paper released.</li>\n<li><strong>Q2&ndash;Q3 2025 (Spring/Summer 2025):</strong> Stakeholder consultation and policy development on reforms; legislative process for new multipliers (Non-Domestic Rating Act passed in April 2025).</li>\n<li><strong>11 Sep 2025:</strong> Interim Report on business rates reform published, summarizing consultation feedback and priority reform areas.</li>\n<li><strong>26 Nov 2025 (Autumn Budget 2025):</strong> Crucial announcement of: 1) 2026-27 multipliers (actual rates for small/standard/general/high-value categories), and 2) Transitional Relief details for the 2026 revaluation. Also, likely updates or decisions on some reform proposals.</li>\n<li><strong>Dec 2025:</strong> Draft 2026 Rating List (new Rateable Values for all properties) published by VOA for review.</li>\n<li><strong>1 April 2026:</strong> New system goes live: New multipliers and reliefs take effect, 2026 revaluation comes into force (final values list published). Businesses will start paying based on the new rates and values. Transitional relief (if applicable) begins to phase in changes.</li>\n<li><strong>2026&ndash;2029:</strong> Further business rates reforms to be phased in over the Parliament. Watch for annual Budget statements or consultations introducing changes to reliefs, compliance obligations, and possibly new banding structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<img alt=\"Calendar graphic highlighting the April 2026 business rates milestone\" class=\"image-inline article-image\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-10-02-business-rates-forward-look-what-the-latest-updates-mean-for-your-business/image4.webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<h2>Preparing for the Changes &ndash; What Should You Do?</h2>\n<p>With significant changes on the horizon, now is the time for businesses to plan and ensure they are prepared for the 2026 business rates reset. Here are some key steps and considerations:</p>\n<h3>1. Assess Your Portfolio</h3>\n<p>Review the rateable values of your properties. Identify which ones are likely to fall under the new RHL relief (RVs &lt; &pound;500k in retail/hospitality/leisure use) and which, if any, might be subject to the high-value multiplier (&ge; &pound;500k RV). Understanding where you stand will help estimate the potential impact on each property's rates bill.</p>\n<h3>2. Budget for 2026&ndash;27</h3>\n<p>While we await exact multiplier figures, you can do scenario planning. For instance, if you have a warehouse around the &pound;500k mark, consider the possibility of a ~10-20% rates increase. If you operate shops or restaurants, anticipate the promised rate cuts. Keep an eye out for the draft RV list in December 2025 &ndash; it will allow you to calculate preliminary bills (we can assist with this once the data is out).</p>\n<h3>3. Consider Reliefs and Appeals</h3>\n<p>If a property's draft 2026 RV seems too high or incorrect, be ready to engage with the VOA's \"Check, Challenge, Appeal\" process once the new list is in force. Additionally, explore any other reliefs you might be eligible for (small business relief, etc.) in light of the new values. For empty properties or those undergoing improvements, see how upcoming reform proposals might benefit you, and consider timing works or occupancy to maximize relief.</p>\n<h3>4. Stay Informed on Reforms</h3>\n<p>The business rates landscape will continue to evolve. Subscribe to updates or follow industry news around each Budget. New relief schemes or duties (like the annual returns to VOA requirement coming soon) could mean new responsibilities &ndash; or opportunities &ndash; for your business. Being aware early will keep you compliant and possibly save you money.</p>\n<h3>5. Get Expert Advice</h3>\n<p>Navigating business rates can be complex, especially with a more layered system of multipliers and an upcoming revaluation. Our team of business rates experts is closely following these developments. We can help model your 2026 liabilities, handle communications with the VOA, and identify strategies to mitigate increases or secure reliefs.</p>\n<img alt=\"Business rates experts reviewing property plans and financial charts\" class=\"image-inline article-image\" height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-10-02-business-rates-forward-look-what-the-latest-updates-mean-for-your-business/image5.webp\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p>In summary, the Business Rates Forward Look outlines a future where the tax burden is a bit more balanced: high street businesses will get a much-needed break, while online giants and large properties contribute a bit more. It's a positive step for many of our clients in retail, hospitality, and leisure, and part of a broader push to modernize a historically challenging tax. Change, however, often brings questions.

    "content": "<p>The UK High Court's recent decision <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2025/2336.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[2025] EWHC 2336 (Ch)</a></strong> marks a turning point for commercial landlords trying to reduce \"empty rates\" on vacant properties. In plain English, the court cracked down on <strong>artificial tax-avoidance ploys</strong> while upholding mitigation methods that involve <strong>genuine use of the property</strong>. This ruling effectively invalidated certain schemes deemed ineffective or abusive, such as the notorious <strong>\"SPV lease-and-liquidate\" strategy</strong>, and it reinforced that only <strong>real, beneficial occupation can earn business rates relief</strong>. Below we unpack the judgment, explore its implications for stakeholders, compare popular mitigation tactics, and explain why compliance-focused solutions like VacatAd are emerging as the go-to approach in this new landscape.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"High Court Ruling Impact Visual showing gavel with ticks on the right and crosses on the left\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image1.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<h2>The 2025 High Court Decision &ndash; Explained in Plain Language</h2>\n<p>In this case, <strong>two local councils (Wigan and Trafford)</strong> challenged a property investor's avoidance schemes designed to dodge empty property rates. The schemes involved granting a short lease of an empty property to a freshly created <strong>special purpose vehicle (SPV) company</strong>, which would then be voluntarily liquidated (MVL) to invoke a legal exemption for properties owned by companies in liquidation. In theory, as long as the SPV sat in liquidation holding the lease, nobody owed business rates on the empty building. <strong>The High Court firmly rejected this ploy</strong>. It ruled that these SPV \"phoenix\" schemes did not transfer liability in any meaningful way &ndash; <strong>the owner remained the de facto possessor and thus liable for the rates</strong>. In the judge's view, paper leases to shell companies with no real occupation were shams and ineffective for avoiding rates. <strong>The result: the landlord in question was declared liable for the full business rates bill</strong>, and the court issued a clear warning that such contrived arrangements do not work.</p>\n<p>Equally important, the judgment highlighted the boundary between <strong>abusive avoidance and legitimate mitigation</strong>. The judge noted that under rating law, occupation must be <strong>actual, exclusive, of some benefit to the occupier, and not too transient</strong>. Simply installing a dummy tenant with no intention to use the property fails these tests. By contrast, if a property is occupied &ndash; even minimally &ndash; for a real business purpose of the occupier, that can count as genuine <strong>\"beneficial occupation\"</strong> in the eyes of the law. In other words, the ruling confirms that <strong>landlords cannot escape rates by creative legal tricks alone</strong>; there needs to be substance behind the occupation. Schemes set up solely to avoid tax, with no independent business use, are likely outside what Parliament ever intended to reward. <strong>The High Court's message was confident and clear: if you want the rates relief, put the property to real use &ndash; or pay up.</strong></p>\n<h2>Schemes Deemed \"Ineffective\" or Abusive</h2>\n<p>This decision explicitly condemned <strong>SPV lease-and-liquidate schemes</strong>, calling them out as ineffective. That aligns with a <strong>2021 UK Supreme Court precedent in <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2021/16.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hurstwood Properties v. Rossendale BC</a></strong>, which likewise pierced through such \"managed insolvency\" tactics. In those schemes, owners formed short-lived companies to take on leases and then dissolved them, thinking the rates liability would vanish with the company. <strong>Courts have now made it plain that this won't fool the law &ndash; the owner who concocted the arrangement stays on the hook.</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"Effective vs Ineffective Schemes Comparison showing two columns with green ticks and red crosses\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image 2.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<p>Other avoidance models have also come under fire. The judgment and recent case law frowned upon certain <strong>property guardian arrangements</strong> and similar ruses. For example, some landlords license \"live-in guardians\" in empty commercial buildings hoping to switch the tax to cheaper council tax or to argue the building is occupied. <strong>The Court of Appeal in <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/1637.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Southwark LBC v. Ludgate House Ltd (2020)</a></strong> found that if the owner retains control and guardians are installed purely as a security service, <strong>the owner remains the rateable occupier &ndash; meaning the scheme doesn't mitigate business rates at all</strong>. In short, merely having people on-site is not enough if they're effectively there on the owner's behalf; such guardian schemes can fail to transfer liability and may even raise legal issues (as Ludgate House illustrated, where <strong>40+ guardians in an office block ultimately left the owner facing the full &pound;3m rates bill</strong>).</p>\n<p>Likewise, charity leasing schemes have faced scrutiny as potentially abusive if the charity's use is nominal. Landlords have leased vacant space to charities to claim the 80% charitable relief on rates, sometimes with the property hardly being used for genuine charitable purposes. Courts have signalled that form over substance won't fly here either. If a charity occupies a property in name only (for instance, just storing a few items or putting up a sign while the building remains largely unused), authorities can argue the relief is not genuinely applicable. In fact, courts have consistently ruled against schemes where the primary intent is avoiding rates rather than carrying out bona fide activities. The message is that charity arrangements must reflect real charitable use of the premises, not just a tax dodge, or they risk being deemed a sham.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the High Court affirmed that <strong>not all mitigation strategies are illegitimate &ndash; only those lacking real occupation</strong>. Schemes involving actual short-term occupancy for a business purpose emerged as lawful when properly executed. <strong>The court in City of London v. 48th Street &amp; Principled Offsite Logistics (2025)</strong>, decided a few months before the SPV case, upheld a <strong>\"box storage\" scheme as a valid means of rates mitigation</strong>. In that model, a specialist company periodically took possession of empty properties for a set time (<strong>previously 6 weeks, now ~3 months</strong>) and stored goods (boxes) on-site, before vacating. This triggered a new empty-period exemption for the owner. The judge agreed that such intermittent occupation does meet the legal test: it was <strong>actual (boxes physically present), exclusive to the company, and provided a benefit</strong> &ndash; the company was paid to store items and facilitate the rates savings. The fact that the motive was to mitigate rates did not negate the reality of the occupation. As long as the use wasn't trivial or pretended (e.g. leaving trash or \"abandoned\" goods would not count), the court was satisfied. <strong>In effect, the judiciary drew a line: creating a real, if modest, use of the property is acceptable, whereas purely paper arrangements or token uses with no real service or benefit are not.</strong></p>\n<h2>Ripple Effects: What This Means for Owners, Councils, and Consultants</h2>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"Stakeholder Impact Infographic showing three connected circles with building, town hall, and briefcase icons\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image 3.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<h3>Property Owners/Landlords</h3>\n<p><strong>Landlords now have much clearer guidance on what will &ndash; and won't &ndash; fly when it comes to avoiding empty property rates</strong>. <strong>The era of \"clever\" avoidance tricks is fading</strong>. Owners who were relying on phoenix companies or dubious leases to escape rates should consider themselves on notice: <strong>those methods may not only fail but could land them with backdated bills and legal costs</strong>. <strong>Compliance and transparency are more critical than ever</strong>. The upside is that truly using your empty property, even in a limited way, remains a lawful path to relief. The court essentially blessed good-faith mitigation &ndash; so long as you play by the rules (i.e. ensure actual occupation for the required period and a legitimate purpose). <strong>Landlords will need to shift from avoidance-minded thinking to use-minded thinking</strong>. Many are now exploring partnerships with reputable rates mitigation services that emphasise genuine temporary use (for example, storage, pop-up ventures, or tech installations) rather than contrivances. In practical terms, owners should be prepared for mitigation arrangements to last a bit longer &ndash; <strong>recent law changes extended the required occupation period from 6 weeks to 3 months to reset an empty relief</strong>. This means committing to short-term occupation arrangements that span a quarter-year at a time. <strong>The message to landlords: embrace innovative, compliant uses for your vacant space or budget for the full rates &ndash; but don't bank on loopholes that no longer exist.</strong></p>\n<h3>Local Authorities</h3>\n<p>For councils, the judgment is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a victory &ndash; the court sided with authorities in striking down blatant avoidance schemes, potentially unlocking significant unpaid rates revenue. Councils have long been frustrated by owners exploiting technical gaps to avoid rates, and now the courts have backed them up by calling out those tactics as abuse of the system. We can expect councils to feel emboldened to challenge dubious schemes more readily, knowing the courts are receptive to the substance-over-form approach. In fact, multiple authorities had already banded together behind test cases (like the ones in this ruling) to settle the law. Going forward, councils are likely to scrutinise claimed occupations very closely. If an owner asserts that an empty property is occupied (to claim relief), the billing authority may conduct inspections and demand evidence of meaningful use. However, the ruling also implicitly greenlights properly run mitigation &ndash; meaning councils will still see some rate-free periods they must honour when owners do it right. This puts pressure on authorities to distinguish legitimate temporary use from sham tactics. They'll be updating their internal guidelines and perhaps lobbying for further legislative reform (as seen in Wales, which considered requiring 6 months occupation for a reset). In short, councils will push harder against avoidance, but they must also respect the \"rules of the game\" laid down by the courts, which permit cyclical occupation schemes unless Parliament says otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Business Rates Consultants</h3>\n<p>The professional advisors and firms that devise rates mitigation strategies are at a crossroads. The High Court's firm stance against artificial schemes means that consultants must adapt or risk liability themselves. Historically, some consultants offered aggressive avoidance models (like setting up SPVs or finding sham charities/tenants). Those advisors now face reputational and legal risks if they continue to peddle disallowed schemes. The smarter move for consultants is to pivot to compliance-first solutions &ndash; helping clients implement strategies that will clearly meet the legal test of occupation. This might involve coordinating short-term genuine occupiers (storage providers, interim tenants, pop-up operators, or service installations) and ensuring all documentation, timing, and conduct align with case law. Consultants will also need to stay abreast of evolving laws &ndash; for example, advising clients on the new 3-month occupation requirement and any upcoming anti-avoidance rules. The recent judgment gives consultants a clearer framework to advise within. In fact, it arguably professionalises the field: success now depends on creativity and credibility. Those consultants who can deliver innovative yet lawful mitigation (for instance, technology-driven occupation solutions) will thrive, whereas those clinging to loopholes will fall behind. Overall, the emphasis is shifting to transparency, robust evidence of use, and cooperation with local authorities (rather than hiding from them). Consultants who facilitate win-win solutions &ndash; helping landlords save on rates while ensuring councils can see real community or business use &ndash; are likely to become the preferred choice in this new era.</p>\n<h2>Old Tactics vs New Strategies: A Comparison of Mitigation Methods</h2>\n<p><strong>Business rates mitigation has evolved from dubious avoidance ploys toward more genuine short-term uses</strong>. Below is a comparative look at the main categories of strategies, from the now-discredited historic schemes to modern, compliance-oriented approaches:</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"Comparison Table of Mitigation Methods showing five rows with red crosses, yellow warnings, and green ticks\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image 4.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<h3>1. SPV Lease-and-Liquidate Schemes (Historic Avoidance)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it was:</strong> An owner creates a Special Purpose Vehicle company, grants it a lease of the empty property, and then immediately liquidates that company (a Members' Voluntary Liquidation). Under rating law, properties owned by companies in winding-up were exempt from rates, so the plan was to let the building sit \"owned\" by a liquidating shell, effectively sidestepping the tax.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it boomed:</strong> This was a pure avoidance tactic &ndash; no need to actually use the building at all. It gained popularity about a decade ago, allowing landlords of large empty premises to dramatically reduce their rates bills by playing a corporate shell game.</p>\n<p><strong>What the courts say now:</strong> <strong>It doesn't work</strong>. The approach has been struck down by the Supreme Court and High Court as an abuse. In the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2021/16.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Hurstwood case</a></strong>, the Supreme Court applied the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/1.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ramsay principle</a></strong> (an anti-tax-avoidance rule) to interpret the business rates laws in line with their purpose &ndash; meaning courts will ignore contrived transactions that have no purpose other than avoiding tax. The SPV leases were deemed shams, since the SPV never actually occupied or traded, and the real control stayed with the owner. <strong>The recent 2025 High Court decision [2336 Ch] has confirmed that these \"lease-to-liquidate\" schemes are ineffective at law</strong>. The landlord remains the liable party for the duration of the supposed scheme. In essence, judges have pierced the corporate veil and called out the substance: <strong>an empty building is still empty, and you can't escape rates just by interposing a paper company</strong>. <strong>These schemes are now largely dead &ndash; and any owners still attempting them are taking a huge risk</strong>. The prevailing legal view is that <strong>if no one is genuinely in occupation, the rates liability cannot be magicked away by creative legal ownership</strong>.</p>\n<h3>2. Live-In Property Guardian Models</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Using property guardians &ndash; individuals who live in vacant commercial properties at low cost, ostensibly to secure and maintain them. Companies arrange for a number of guardians (often young professionals or key workers) to occupy an empty office or industrial building under licence agreements. The idea from a rates perspective is twofold: (a) possibly have the building reclassified (or parts of it) as domestic (triggering council tax rather than business rates), or (b) argue that the building is occupied, so it's not liable for empty rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Guardians do provide real occupancy &ndash; the lights are on and someone's home &ndash; and they can deter vandals or squatters, bringing some practical benefits to the owner. For a while, some owners saw this as a semi-legitimate workaround: you get occupancy, some security, and avoid the punitive empty rates. However, this approach can be complex. Converting a commercial building into living space may require meeting housing safety standards. Moreover, council tax on multiple guardian-occupied rooms can still be costly, and if the building remains one hereditament, authorities might insist on business rates anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal status:</strong> The courts have grown sceptical of guardian schemes as a rates solution. The key issue is who is in \"rateable occupation.\" In many guardian setups, the guardians sign licences that give them very limited rights &ndash; the guardian company (and ultimately the owner) retains control over the building. In the <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/1637.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ludgate House case</a>, the Court of Appeal found that guardians did not have exclusive possession of any part of the property (they could be moved at will, akin to lodgers), so the owner was still deemed the occupier for rating purposes. Essentially, because the guardians were there to perform a service for the owner (property security) and not as ordinary tenants, their presence didn't transfer liability away from the owner. This ruling severely undermined the viability of guardian schemes to mitigate business rates &ndash; it signalled that a building full of guardians could still be considered \"essentially vacant\" for rating purposes. Post-Ludgate, owners can't assume that having guardians will automatically void an empty rates charge; many councils will press the point that unless guardians hold genuine tenancies and take over discrete units exclusively, the owner remains responsible. Moreover, there's an added wrinkle: packing a building with many residents can trigger housing law obligations (like HMO licensing), adding risk and cost. In sum, while property guardianship can be useful for security and may shift a bit of tax liability in some cases, it is no longer a reliable business rates mitigation tool. The courts have effectively warned: if guardians are just an ad-hoc measure to avoid rates without truly handing over occupation, the scheme may fail. Owners considering guardians now do so more for property protection or social initiative, not as a guaranteed rates solution.</p>\n<h3>3. Storage-Based Schemes</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Using minimal storage or occupation of space to count as re-occupation, thus resetting the empty rate relief clock. A prime example is the strategy of placing boxes, pallets, or goods in an otherwise empty building for a set period. Specialist firms (like Principled Offsite Logistics in a recent case) lease the property for a short term and fill a portion of it with stored items &ndash; often things like documents, furniture, or stock in trade. After the required period of occupation (historically 6 weeks, now generally 3 months), the items are removed, and the building goes back to being \"empty\" &ndash; which under law triggers a new 3-month (or 6-month for industrial) rates-free period for the owner. The cycle can repeat as needed, greatly cutting the owner's overall rates burden (often by more than half).</p>\n<p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> This scheme has been controversial but, importantly, <strong>it has been upheld in court when done correctly</strong>. A body of case law over the past decade &ndash; from the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/2965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Makro case</a></strong> (where storing a few pallets in a warehouse was deemed sufficient occupation) to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2021/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Public Health England v Harlow case</a></strong> (where moving crates of files in and out was ruled valid) &ndash; established that <strong>even slight or partial use of a property can qualify as rateable occupation</strong> so long as the occupation meets the legal criteria. The key is that the occupier (the storage company or whoever) intends to use the space and gains some benefit from it, however minimal. <strong>Courts have taken a \"morally neutral\" stance: an occupier's motive of saving rates does not void the occupation, as long as the occupation is real</strong>. In the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">City of London v. Principled Offsite Logistics (2025) case</a></strong>, the High Court reaffirmed this principle, rejecting the council's argument that putting boxes in a room solely to avoid tax was an abuse. The judge noted that Parliament was aware of these schemes and chose not to outlaw them, instead only extending the occupation period required. He found that the storage of boxes did constitute actual occupation &ndash; the company was using the property for its business (providing storage services) and thus the legal definition of \"occupied\" was satisfied. It didn't matter that the boxes' only purpose was generating a rates exemption later; what mattered was that each day the boxes were there, the company had exclusive use of that space and an intention to occupy (the items weren't abandoned or unrelated). <strong>As a result, such storage-based schemes are still viable, albeit now requiring a longer occupation period (3+ months)</strong>. They must be done by the book: the occupying entity should have a legitimate lease/licence, actually move goods in, and document the occupancy thoroughly. If done sloppily (e.g. leaving junk or not truly taking possession), councils might challenge it. But when properly managed, <strong>\"intermittent occupation\" strategies have a strong track record in court</strong>. For owners, this is good news &ndash; <strong>it's a proven method to achieve significant savings legally</strong>. The downside is it typically involves paying a fee or profit-share to the specialist company and coordinating the logistics of moving items in and out. Still, compared to paying full rates on an idle building, this approach can be a lifesaver. It has effectively forced councils to concede that if you can find some meaningful interim use for your property, however small, you are entitled to the relief &ndash; an outcome repeatedly confirmed by judges and much preferable to unlawful avoidance.</p>\n<h3>4. Charity Leasing Arrangements</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Leasing or licensing the empty property to a charitable organisation so that the premises is occupied for charitable purposes and thus qualifies for charity rate relief (usually 80% off the rates). Often the charity pays a nominal rent (or none at all), and the property owner might even donate funds to the charity to offset the remaining 20% rates, making it cost-neutral for the charity. The owner saves 80% of the rates they'd otherwise owe, at the cost of effectively \"renting\" the building to the charity.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> In principle, this can be a legitimate arrangement &ndash; many genuine charities do use otherwise-vacant shops or offices for storage, offices, pop-up thrift stores, food banks, and so on, benefiting both charity and owner. However, abuses emerged with \"charity\" schemes where the charitable use was minimal or merely a facade. Some cases surfaced where properties were occupied by charities that did very little with the space (e.g. a charity might store a few boxes of pamphlets in a huge warehouse just to claim occupancy). Local authorities grew wise to this and have contested such setups, arguing that the property was not \"wholly or mainly\" used for charitable purposes &ndash; a requirement for the relief. If a court finds that a charity's presence is nominal and primarily to help the owner avoid rates, it can disallow the relief.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal status:</strong> There isn't a single landmark Supreme Court case on this issue, but multiple instances in the lower courts and tribunals have sent a cautionary message. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2013/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Public Safety Charitable Trust v. Milton Keynes (2013)</a>, a charity installed small wireless transmitters in empty properties to broadcast public messages and claimed charitable use; the High Court found this use was de minimis and not sufficient to count as \"occupation for charitable purposes,\" so the full rates were payable. Similarly, councils have won cases where the charity did not meaningfully occupy the premises on a day-to-day basis. The courts tend to look at the substance: Is the charity actually conducting its charitable activities from the property in a substantial way? If yes, the relief is earned; if not, it's effectively a tax dodge. The recent emphasis on \"primary intent\" supports this &ndash; if the primary intent is avoiding tax rather than delivering charitable work, the arrangement could be voided. That said, genuine charity arrangements remain acceptable. If, say, a charity that provides community services truly uses an empty store as a drop-in center or a training facility, that's legitimate beneficial use and relief applies. Many councils themselves prefer to see empty units used by charities (for community good) rather than lying idle or hosting sham occupiers. The key is transparency and genuine use: owners should ensure any charity occupation is well-documented, with clear charitable activities taking place. It's wise to avoid \"charity\" deals with shell charities or those suggested by middlemen that promise guaranteed relief without clear use &ndash; those are red flags. In summary, charity leasing can be a win-win but only when it's authentic. Post-2025, one can expect harsher scrutiny: an owner who tries to game the system by nominal charity deals could find themselves challenged in court and, if the facts show no real charitable use, stuck paying full rates (and possibly accused of fraud in extreme cases). Thus, while still a tool in the toolbox, charity relief schemes must be approached with caution and integrity.</p>\n<h3>5. Technology-Led Intermittent Occupation (VacatAd's Model)</h3>\n<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A cutting-edge approach exemplified by VacatAd, which uses technology to provide intermittent beneficial occupation without altering the property. In practical terms, VacatAd installs a small \"plug-and-play\" device on the premises that creates a public Wi-Fi network and digital advertising platform. This device needs only a power outlet and possibly an internet connection. Once active, it turns the vacant property into a hub providing free internet access to the surrounding community and displaying targeted local advertisements. The property is thus occupied for a set period (typically 13 weeks, just over the 3-month threshold now required) by VacatAd's service. After that period, VacatAd removes the equipment and the property can enjoy a fresh empty rates exemption. The cycle can then repeat as needed, similarly to storage schemes but with high-tech flair.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it's innovative:</strong> Unlike storage or guardians, no physical alterations or human presence is required &ndash; the device is non-intrusive and installation is extremely simple (literally plugging in a unit). There's no mess or significant space taken up, and the owner can continue marketing the property to real tenants during the process (VacatAd can vacate on short notice if a tenant is found). The model directly addresses community needs by boosting connectivity &ndash; a clear social benefit. Importantly, the technology provides real-time monitoring and data, allowing VacatAd and the owner to prove the occupation and usage to authorities with concrete evidence (e.g. logs of Wi-Fi usage, uptime, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Legal footing:</strong> VacatAd's approach is firmly grounded in the legal concept of beneficial occupation. By broadcasting free Wi-Fi and ads, VacatAd is deriving a business benefit (advertising revenue or platform growth) and providing a service to the public. <strong>This is not a sham; it's an actual use of the property for the purpose of the occupying company's business, satisfying the \"beneficial to the occupier\" test</strong>. Each day the device operates, VacatAd is in exclusive occupation of a portion of the property (even if it's just the space the device sits in and its Wi-Fi signal footprint) for its commercial aims. The courts have indicated that even a small physical use can qualify, so long as it's intentional and not trivial &ndash; VacatAd's service clearly meets that bar, as it's delivering tangible outputs (internet connectivity and advertising) and is not just pretending to occupy. Moreover, VacatAd's model was developed with the latest case law in mind. It aligns with precedents like <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/2965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Makro</a> and Principled Offsite &ndash; but arguably with even more bona fide purpose, since the Wi-Fi service has inherent community value, unlike boxes which \"serve no commercial purpose save rates mitigation.\" <strong>VacatAd has reportedly achieved a 100% success rate in securing rate relief for clients using this method, with no failed cases to date</strong>. In practice, councils presented with VacatAd's occupation have accepted it as meeting the criteria (likely because challenging it would be an uphill battle given it checks all the legal boxes of occupation). The transparency of the model also helps &ndash; VacatAd handles all notifications to the council and provides evidence of the occupation up front, which fosters trust and preempts disputes.</p>\n<p>In summary: Technology-led intermittent occupation is emerging as the new gold standard for rates mitigation. VacatAd's model showcases how leveraging tech can create a win-win: the owner saves money legally, the occupier (VacatAd) runs a useful service, and the local community benefits from free Wi-Fi and support for local businesses through advertising. It's a far cry from sneaky shell companies or pet snail farms (yes, someone tried a snail farm ploy to claim agricultural rates exemption &ndash; it was quickly deemed a sham by the courts!). The tech approach is clean, ethical, and robust against legal challenge. As the business rates landscape shifts toward demanding genuine use, solutions like VacatAd's are perfectly tuned to the new expectations.</p>\n<h2>Legally Defining \"Beneficial Occupation\" After the Ruling</h2>\n<p>One of the most significant outcomes of the recent court decisions is the <strong>clearer legal lens on \"beneficial occupation\"</strong>. Post-ruling, it's worth distilling what this term means, because <strong>it's the crux of which schemes survive scrutiny</strong>.</p>\n<p>To be rateable, an occupation must generally satisfy <strong>four elements (often called the <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/6.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Laing Properties tests</a>): actual, exclusive, beneficial (to the occupier), and not too transient</strong>. The 2025 judgments reaffirm and refine how these apply in practice:</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"The Four Tests of Beneficial Occupation showing four connected boxes with presence, lock, arrow, and clock icons\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image 5.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Actual occupation:</strong> There must be some physical presence or activity in the property. It doesn't have to be 24/7 or involve the whole building &ndash; using even a part of the premises can suffice. But it cannot be a mere token presence; an empty promise of future use or a symbolic gesture won't count. In plain terms, something has to be happening on the property (boxes stored, devices broadcasting, people working or living there, etc.) during the period in question.</p>\n<p><strong>Exclusive occupation:</strong> The occupier must have control of the space and be able to exclude others from it. This is where many guardian schemes faltered &ndash; the guardians had no exclusive possession of any specific area. By contrast, a company that leases a property for storage or tech use has the legal right to control access to that area for the lease term, meeting the exclusivity requirement. Post-ruling, it's clear that if the original landlord retains general control (as with guardians or sham leases), the occupier is not truly exclusive and thus not the ratepayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Beneficial occupation (for the occupier):</strong> This is the heart of the matter. \"Beneficial\" means the occupation serves some purpose or value for the occupier &ndash; it benefits them in their own business or objectives. Crucially, the courts have adopted a \"morally neutral\" standpoint here: the benefit can be as simple as enabling a future tax relief for the occupier (as with PHE storing its files to later get a void period). The High Court stated that an occupier's purpose can indeed be to obtain a future rates exemption, and that still counts as a benefit to the occupier. What doesn't count is if the supposed occupier has no independent purpose at all &ndash; for example, an SPV with no business, created only on paper, has no real \"benefit\" from sitting empty. Post-2025, genuine beneficial occupation is defined by intent and use: the occupier must intend to occupy (not just create a semblance) and use the premises in a way that furthers their own interests (business or charitable), even if indirectly. If the occupation is purely for the benefit of the owner (and the occupier is a stooge), or if the \"use\" is so insignificant it's essentially nonexistent, it won't meet this test. The courts gave examples: leaving abandoned goods in a property is not beneficial occupation, nor is occupation that's only about the upkeep of the property itself (that would benefit the owner, not the occupier). On the flip side, running a community Wi-Fi device does benefit the occupier (VacatAd) by advancing their business model, and storing goods benefits the storage company by fulfilling a contract and earning fees. The lens now is: is the occupier doing something of value to them (or their cause, if a charity) on the premises? If yes, it's beneficial occupation.</p>\n<p><strong>Not too transient:</strong> The occupation must last for a sufficient time to count &ndash; historically more than a fleeting moment. Case law had set a loose benchmark of at least 6 weeks. Now, the law itself has stepped in to specify a minimum period for resetting relief: 6 weeks was the old rule, now it's 3 months in England for new exemptions. So practically, \"transient\" means anything less than 6 weeks wouldn't have counted before; going forward, any mitigation occupier will need to plan on around 3 months to ensure the relief (and to satisfy the updated statutory requirement). The High Court's recent rulings didn't overturn this notion &ndash; if anything, they underscored it by referencing the regulatory change. A weekend pop-up shop, for example, won't restart your empty rate relief; it's too transient. The occupation should be stable enough to be a meaningful interval. In legal terms, if you can demonstrate an uninterrupted occupation for the legislatively required period (13 weeks to be safe), you're in solid territory.</p>\n<p>In summary, <strong>\"beneficial occupation\" post-2025 means a bona fide use by an occupier for its own ends, carried on for a realistic duration, with the occupier controlling the space as needed</strong>. The courts have essentially told landlords: <strong>\"We don't care if your underlying motive is to save on rates &ndash; just give us an occupier who is actually using the property for something worthwhile (however small), and we'll call that occupied. Otherwise, it's empty and you pay.\"</strong> This clear delineation now defines the playing field for all mitigation strategies.</p>\n<h2>VacatAd: Compliance Meets Proof &ndash; A Model Built on Case Law</h2>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"VacatAd's Technology-Led Occupation Model showing process flow from building to router to calendar to wifi signal to checkmark\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image 6.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<p>Against this tightened legal backdrop, VacatAd's model stands out as not only fully compliant but also proven in practice. It directly embodies the lessons from case law while adding its own layer of reliability. Let's break down why VacatAd's approach is a perfect poster child for the post-2025 ideal of rates mitigation:</p>\n<p><strong>Rooted in Existing Case Law:</strong> VacatAd's strategy was crafted with the legal precedents in mind. The idea of using a property to broadcast Wi-Fi and ads for a period is essentially a modern twist on the Makro/Intermittent Occupation cases. It takes the concept of \"slight occupation + intent = valid\" that was upheld in <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/2965.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Makro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2021/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PHE v Harlow</a> and gives it a 21st-century upgrade. By providing a service (Wi-Fi) from the premises, VacatAd ensures the occupation is unquestionably beneficial to the occupier, paralleling how storing goods was beneficial to the storage company in earlier cases. Moreover, VacatAd likely drew from the <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2018/35.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Franses v Cavendish</a> principle (from property law, cited in the 2025 judgment) which warns that an intention that exists only conditional on obtaining a benefit is suspect. VacatAd avoids this by actually implementing the occupation (installing and operating the equipment) &ndash; it's not a conditional plan; it's an executed action, much like Principled Offsite physically placing boxes to manifest intent. In short, every element of VacatAd's occupation model can be mapped to a judicially approved concept: actual presence (device installed), exclusivity (VacatAd controls the device and its function), beneficial use (running a commercial/community service), and non-transience (13 weeks on-site). This alignment with case law principles gives VacatAd a rock-solid foundation. It's the opposite of testing a grey area &ndash; it's operating squarely within the bright lines the courts have drawn for acceptable schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>100% Track Record of Success:</strong> Perhaps the most compelling proof is in the pudding &ndash; <strong>VacatAd boasts a 100% success rate to date in securing empty rates relief for its clients</strong>. Every property that has gone through VacatAd's 13-week occupancy has qualified for the subsequent rate-free period, with no council successfully challenging the arrangement. This is a strong endorsement that VacatAd's model holds up under scrutiny. The company confidently guarantees this success, explicitly stating that each of its tenancies is arranged to meet all legal tests (exclusive, actual, beneficial, non-transient) such that relief is assured. While past performance is not a legal precedent, <strong>the fact that no VacatAd case has ended up in court (or if it did, none has lost)</strong> indicates that local authorities, when presented with VacatAd's thorough approach, have conceded its validity. <strong>In an industry littered with schemes that sometimes work or carry legal risks, VacatAd's unblemished record is a standout</strong>. It suggests not only confidence in the model but also a level of due diligence and precision in execution that keeps disputes to a minimum. Part of this success likely stems from VacatAd's transparency &ndash; they handle communications with councils, make sure the occupation is well documented, and don't try to hide the motive. This forthright approach builds credibility with authorities, who can see that the property is being used in a beneficial way, even if temporarily. <strong>Ultimately, the combination of legal soundness and proven outcomes means landlords can engage VacatAd with peace of mind that they're not venturing into a tax grey area, but rather leveraging a court-sanctioned method.</strong></p>\n<p>In essence, VacatAd took the letter and spirit of the law and built a service model around complying with it &ndash; and it shows. By referencing and respecting existing case law, and by delivering a perfect record of relief claims, VacatAd demonstrates that it's possible to mitigate business rates without fighting the law, instead working with it. This is exactly the direction the landscape is moving: from cat-and-mouse avoidance games toward compliant, transparent solutions.</p>\n<h2>VacatAd's Key Differentiators in the Post-Ruling Era</h2>\n<p>With the business rates mitigation game now favouring compliant innovation, VacatAd rises to the top by offering a solution that is not only legal but also simple, safe, and socially positive. Here are VacatAd's major differentiators that set it apart from both old-school avoidance schemes and other mitigation services:</p>\n<p><strong>Plug-and-Play Simplicity:</strong> VacatAd's approach requires virtually no effort or alteration on the part of the landlord. The technology is a self-contained unit that needs only a standard power outlet to start providing Wi-Fi coverage. There's no construction, no fit-out, no on-site staffing &ndash; meaning no disruption to the property. You can literally plug it in and let it do its job. This simplicity is a far cry from, say, moving crates in and out or accommodating live-in guardians. It's hassle-free and fast to deploy, ensuring landlords can start a mitigation period quickly. And because it's plug-and-play, VacatAd can also pack up and leave on short notice if the owner secures a long-term tenant &ndash; offering maximum flexibility to the landlord's leasing efforts. You keep marketing your property while VacatAd runs in the background, with confidence that VacatAd can vacate whenever you need (often within days).</p>\n<p><strong>Zero Property Alteration:</strong> With VacatAd, there is no need to modify the building at all. No partitions, no cabling infrastructure beyond perhaps an internet line (and even that can be wireless). The device is non-invasive &ndash; it doesn't damage walls or floors, and leaves behind no trace once removed. Compare this to some other strategies: guardians might require basic living amenity installations; storage might involve pallets that could scuff floors or require insurance for goods; pseudo-agriculture schemes (like absurd snail farms) could involve live creatures or special fixtures &ndash; all potentially problematic. VacatAd's solution is gentle on the property &ndash; your building stays exactly as it is. This is crucial for owners of prime commercial spaces who don't want any alterations that might deter prospective tenants or violate insurance and safety regulations. VacatAd's device sits quietly and leaves quietly, preserving the property's condition. That makes it an attractive option for landlords who are understandably protective of their asset.</p>\n<p><strong>Social and Community Benefit:</strong> Unlike sterile schemes that do nothing for the locale, VacatAd generates positive externalities. By broadcasting free public Wi-Fi, it provides a service to anyone in the vicinity &ndash; shoppers, residents, passers-by &ndash; who can get online at no cost. In today's world, connectivity is almost a public utility, and VacatAd turns an empty building into a temporary digital hotspot. This can be a boon in areas with poor internet coverage or for individuals who can't afford mobile data. Additionally, VacatAd's platform displays targeted advertising for local small businesses, effectively giving community businesses affordable exposure. This means the vacant property starts contributing to the local economy by promoting nearby shops and services. There's also potential for tie-ins with local charitable or civic messaging (e.g. public service announcements over the Wi-Fi splash page). All of this translates into a narrative of social value: the property isn't just sitting idle &ndash; it's actively benefiting the community during VacatAd's occupancy. Local authorities and the public generally view this far more favorably than opaque avoidance maneuvers. In fact, the social benefit aspect can enhance the owner's reputation as a responsible corporate citizen, turning the avoidance stigma into a community partnership story.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Monitoring and Transparency:</strong> VacatAd provides a real-time dashboard for property owners, showing the status of the occupancy period, Wi-Fi usage stats, and other relevant metrics. This means owners are kept fully in the loop with what's happening in their building. The system likely includes motion-sensitive security cameras as well, so the property is monitored against intrusions while VacatAd is in place &ndash; a bonus security service. From a compliance perspective, the monitoring data is gold: it's evidence that can be shared with councils to prove active use (e.g. X number of Wi-Fi sessions served this week, etc.). VacatAd also takes charge of all dealings with the local authority &ndash; they notify the council when they move in, provide the necessary details, and similarly inform when they vacate. This proactive communication ensures everything is above board. For the owner, this hands-off transparency is a relief &ndash; no nasty surprises, no hiding behind technicalities. \"Zero surprises\" as VacatAd calls it. The owner can demonstrate to anyone (be it auditors, board members, or journalists) that their rates mitigation is fully legitimate and openly managed.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Alignment and Compliance:</strong> VacatAd prides itself on being fully aligned with current laws and regulations. They continuously track the legal landscape (and likely had input from legal professionals in designing their service). This means they adapt to changes &ndash; for example, when the law changed to require 3 months' occupation, VacatAd adjusted its model to a 13-week cycle to ensure compliance. They prepare all the necessary legal paperwork (leases/licences) in a way that satisfies the authorities. By having a team of legal and industry experts (as hinted in their materials, the founders have a background in this niche), they ensure no corner is cut. Essentially, VacatAd pre-vets its approach against the kind of challenges councils might raise, closing any loopholes or gaps before they become an issue. This is a stark contrast to some avoidance schemes where the attitude was \"try it and hope it doesn't get challenged.\" VacatAd doesn't gamble; it follows the letter of the law, so both they and the client can be confident in the outcome.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness (\"Pay Only When You Save\"):</strong> VacatAd's model is structured in a performance-based fee way &ndash; in their words, \"pay only when you save.\" Typically, this implies that VacatAd's fee is a portion of the actual rates savings achieved, and if for some reason the savings don't materialize, the client isn't out of pocket. This is hugely attractive to landlords worried about throwing good money after bad on mitigation. It aligns incentives: VacatAd is motivated to successfully deliver the relief, and the owner sees immediate net gain (since the fee comes out of the savings). Moreover, the initial assessment is free and quick &ndash; VacatAd will evaluate a property and estimate potential savings within 24 hours. This low-risk, contingency-style pricing makes the decision a no-brainer for many: if it works, you share the benefit; if it doesn't, you haven't paid. Compared to traditional empty rates (100% cost with no benefit) or even some other schemes that charge flat fees upfront, VacatAd's model is very cost-efficient. You only pay when you're genuinely cutting your rates bill. For budget-conscious landlords, especially after a tough economic period, this can be a lifeline. It turns rates mitigation from a speculative expense into a guaranteed ROI.</p>\n<p><strong>Community and PR Value:</strong> Beyond the technical \"social benefit,\" there's a reputational win for landlords using VacatAd. In an era where companies are expected to demonstrate social responsibility, choosing a mitigation strategy that has community upsides (free Wi-Fi, supporting local business) puts the landlord in a positive light. It's a far cry from being named-and-shamed for avoiding tax. In fact, a landlord could openly publicize the partnership: \"While our store is vacant, we're partnering with VacatAd to provide free internet to the community.\" That's good PR. It shows the landlord is not just sitting on an empty asset or using shadowy tactics, but proactively doing something useful locally. This kind of community value creation is unique to models like VacatAd's. It helps reframe business rates mitigation from a selfish act to a mutually beneficial arrangement. In the long run, such goodwill can only help in dealings with councils and the public. A council might be far more amenable to a VacatAd-style relief (where residents literally benefit) than to an opaque scheme that gives nothing back. So, VacatAd's approach can reduce friction with authorities compared to traditional avoidance. It's effectively aligning the landlord's interest with the community's interest, which is a smart and sustainable strategy.</p>\n<p>In combination, these differentiators make VacatAd a powerful solution in the post-ruling environment. It hits the sweet spot of maximising savings and minimising risk, all while doing genuine good. For landlords who have seen one scheme after another fall foul of the law, VacatAd offers something refreshingly different: a fully above-board method that works and feels right.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: A New Era of Compliance and Transparency &ndash; Why Landlords Should Adapt Now</h2>\n\n<div class=\"article-image\">\n<img alt=\"Conclusion: The New Era of Compliance showing three pillars with eye, checkmark, and shield icons with gavel in background\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/Nov25/image7.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n</div>\n<p><strong>The landscape of business rates mitigation has decisively shifted</strong>. The High Court's 2025 ruling &ndash; alongside other recent judgments &ndash; has drawn a hard line between avoidance gimmicks and authentic occupancy solutions. <strong>The writing is on the wall for landlords: compliance and transparency aren't just buzzwords, they're the only reliable path forward if you want to reduce your rates liabilities</strong>.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, this means <strong>landlords must be very discerning about how they mitigate empty rates</strong>. Schemes that may have been whispered about a few years ago (shell companies, dubious charities, token \"tenants\") are now likely to backfire &ndash; either immediately through legal challenge, or eventually as the law catches up. <strong>The cost of being caught out is high: not only paying the owed rates with interest, but also potential penalties and reputational damage</strong>. <strong>The age of cat-and-mouse avoidance, with councils chasing ever-more-elaborate dodges, is waning. We are entering an age of \"if you want relief, earn it.\"</strong></p>\n<p>For landlords, this is actually an opportunity in disguise. By embracing genuine short-term uses of their properties, owners can transform a vacant liability into something positive &ndash; at least temporarily &ndash; and still get the financial relief. It may require a bit more planning and partnership, but it's a far more sustainable strategy. Authorities are likely to reform business rates further in coming years (the pressures on the system are huge), but whatever changes come, having a track record of compliance will put landlords in a stronger position to take advantage of legitimate reliefs and maybe even influence policy.</p>\n<p>Transparency is now critical. Landlords should be upfront with councils about what they're doing &ndash; invite the council to inspect the property during any claimed occupation, provide evidence, and demonstrate that it's not a sham. This cooperative approach can prevent disputes or quickly resolve them. Remember that many councils have also grown more sophisticated; they know the difference between a ruse and a reasonable scheme. Showing good faith goes a long way. In the spirit of the High Court rulings, being transparent essentially means having nothing to hide &ndash; because your mitigation is by the book. If you feel nervous about explaining your scheme to a council or a judge, that's a sign you might be on shaky ground.</p>\n<p>This is why <strong>VacatAd is uniquely positioned to support landlords in the current climate</strong>. VacatAd embodies exactly what the courts and authorities have been signalling: a mitigation method that is open, honest, and mutually beneficial. <strong>By partnering with VacatAd, a landlord automatically aligns with the new paradigm &ndash; they're not avoiding rates in the dark, they're earning relief in the light</strong>. VacatAd handles the heavy lifting (literally and figuratively): they install the tech, liaise with the council, monitor everything, and ensure all legal criteria are met. <strong>The landlord can rest easy knowing the scheme has been vetted through actual practice and is backed by a 100% success record</strong>. If challenged, VacatAd's approach holds up with clear evidence and legal justification.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, <strong>the High Court's 2025 decision and its ripple effects have ushered in a \"compliance-first\" era for empty property rate mitigation</strong>. <strong>Landlords who adapt quickly by pivoting to transparent, bona fide solutions will save money and sleep better at night</strong>. Those who cling to the old dodges risk financial and legal pain. <strong>The smart move now is to partner with innovators like VacatAd that have proven there's a better way</strong>. By doing so, landlords not only safeguard their bottom line through guaranteed savings, but also turn an otherwise idle asset into a force for community good &ndash; all fully in line with the law. <strong>This alignment of interests &ndash; landlord, law, and community &ndash; is the future of business rates mitigation</strong>. And with VacatAd's help, that future is here and now, ready to be seized by savvy property owners.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "<p>Following the government's reform to the Empty Property Relief (EPR) reset period, landlords must now ensure that any reoccupation lasts for a <strong>full 13 weeks</strong> before a new relief period can be claimed. The change, effective from April 2024, was designed to discourage short-term avoidance tactics &mdash; but it also introduced new administrative and legal challenges for property owners.</p>\n<h2>What changed &mdash; and why it matters</h2>\n<p>Previously, the rule required only <strong>six weeks of occupation</strong> to restart the relief period. That meant some property owners could use very brief tenancies or temporary storage to reset the exemption clock. However, recent reforms &mdash; and reinforced case law &mdash; have extended the timeframe to ensure genuine, sustained occupation.</p>\n<p>If a landlord fails to meet this threshold, they risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Losing entitlement</strong> to a fresh relief period.</li>\n<li><strong>Facing retrospective rates demands</strong> for the supposed \"occupied\" period.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential reputational or legal exposure</strong> if an arrangement is deemed contrived.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p><strong>Critical Change:</strong> The extension from 6 to 13 weeks represents more than double the previous requirement.

The 13-week rule directly supports that principle. To qualify, landlords must demonstrate not only that the property was used &mdash; but that it was used <strong>meaningfully and continuously</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is where technology-based models like VacatAd's come into their own. With continuous connectivity and monitored occupancy, they provide irrefutable proof of real occupation over time.</p>\n<h2>Evidence that stands up to challenge</h2>\n<p>When applying for or defending rates relief, property owners must be able to produce:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A valid lease or licence</strong> for the occupation period.</li>\n<li><strong>Records of activity</strong> (e.g., Wi-Fi usage, maintenance logs, photos).</li>\n<li><strong>Proof of benefit or service delivered</strong> (e.g., local advertising, connectivity reports).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>VacatAd's automated reporting system compiles this evidence effortlessly &mdash; generating <strong>timestamped occupancy data</strong> throughout the 13-week period.</p>\n<img alt=\"VacatAd Technology Solution\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-07-10-understanding-the-13-week-occupation-rule-how-to-stay-compliant/image3.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>Avoiding the pitfalls</h2>\n<p>The new 13-week rule has caught out many landlords who assumed old practices would suffice. Common mistakes include:</p>\n<h3>Short-term licences that fail to meet the 13-week requirement</h3>\n<p>Some landlords still attempt 6 or 8-week arrangements, not realising the threshold has changed. These arrangements are now automatically non-compliant.</p>\n<h3>Nominal use without measurable activity</h3>\n<p>Simply having a lease agreement isn't enough. Local authorities increasingly request evidence of actual use &mdash; Wi-Fi logs, utility records, or access data.</p>\n<h3>Lack of records proving continuous use</h3>\n<p>Even legitimate occupation can be challenged if you cannot demonstrate that it lasted the full period. Gaps in evidence can be fatal to a claim.</p>\n<h3>Failure to vacate properly before claiming renewed relief</h3>\n<p>The property must genuinely become vacant again before a new relief period begins. Authorities are scrutinising whether \"vacant\" periods are genuine.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p><strong>VacatAd Solution:</strong> By contrast, a VacatAd installation ensures that every week of occupation is verified, recorded, and fully compliant &mdash; with automated documentation ready for any authority query.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The VacatAd advantage</h2>\n<p>VacatAd's technology platform is specifically designed to address the challenges of the 13-week rule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic compliance:</strong> Continuous operation and reporting over the full 13 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Zero disruption:</strong> No need for structural changes or sub-letting.</li>\n<li><strong>Community goodwill:</strong> Public Wi-Fi and local advertising generate real economic benefit.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio management:</strong> Dashboards track multiple properties and relief periods at once.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Real-time monitoring</h3>\n<p>Every VacatAd installation generates continuous data streams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wi-Fi connection logs (updated every 15 minutes)</li>\n<li>Device uptime and network health metrics</li>\n<li>Advertising impression counts for local businesses</li>\n<li>System health and maintenance alerts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Automated documentation</h3>\n<p>At the end of the 13-week period, landlords receive comprehensive reports showing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total days of active occupation</li>\n<li>Network uptime percentage</li>\n<li>User engagement statistics</li>\n<li>Community benefit metrics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Strategic value for landlords</h2>\n<p>Compliance is only part of the story. By adopting a system that provides proof of beneficial occupation, landlords can approach local authorities <strong>proactively</strong> &mdash; avoiding disputes and delays.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the ongoing digital engagement offers insight into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Property performance:</strong> Understanding foot traffic and local engagement patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Community reach:</strong> Demonstrating social value for ESG reporting</li>\n<li><strong>Market intelligence:</strong> Data on local area usage can inform future leasing strategies</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate reporting:</strong> Quantifiable community benefit metrics for stakeholders</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Planning your 13-week strategy</h2>\n<p>To successfully navigate the 13-week rule, property owners should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calendar management:</strong> Track when relief periods expire and when occupation must begin</li>\n<li><strong>Installation timing:</strong> Allow time for setup before the relief period ends</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation protocols:</strong> Establish clear record-keeping from day one</li>\n<li><strong>Authority communication:</strong> Be prepared to demonstrate compliance proactively</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio coordination:</strong> Stagger occupation periods across multiple properties for efficient management</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<h3>Best Practice Tip</h3>\n<p>Start your occupation period at least two weeks before your initial relief expires. This buffer ensures you can claim the maximum new relief period while accounting for any installation or setup time.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>What happens if you get it wrong?</h2>\n<p>The consequences of non-compliance can be significant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backdated rates:</strong> Full rates liability for periods incorrectly claimed as occupied</li>\n<li><strong>Interest charges:</strong> Additional costs on late payments</li>\n<li><strong>Future scrutiny:</strong> Increased monitoring of subsequent claims</li>\n<li><strong>Legal costs:</strong> Potential tribunal expenses if disputes arise</li>\n<li><strong>Reputational damage:</strong> Being flagged as a non-compliant landlord</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The 13-week rule has changed how rates mitigation must be approached &mdash; but it hasn't eliminated opportunity. With VacatAd's technology-first system, landlords can satisfy legal definitions of occupation while maintaining operational efficiency and community contribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliant, transparent, and verifiable:</strong> this is what modern rates mitigation looks like in 2025.</p>"

VacatAd's Wi-Fi-based occupation system provides exactly that &mdash; a digital footprint of continuous use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Live connectivity logs:</strong> Demonstrate that the property is active and occupied, showing uptime and user connections every 15 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Motion-sensor integration:</strong> Provides real-time evidence of human presence or maintenance visits.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud monitoring and reports:</strong> Generate automated compliance documentation suitable for local authority queries or appeals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means landlords don't just <em>claim</em> beneficial occupation &mdash; they can <strong>prove it</strong>.</p>\n<img alt=\"VacatAd Smart Monitoring Technology\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-06-18-why-2025-is-the-year-technology-redefined-business-rates-mitigation/image3.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>Lower risk, higher transparency</h2>\n<p>Authorities are becoming increasingly vigilant in identifying contrived arrangements. In contrast, VacatAd's technology is intentionally transparent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Occupation is <strong>visible and measurable</strong>.</li>\n<li>The property provides a <strong>social utility</strong> &mdash; public Wi-Fi access and free advertising for local businesses.</li>\n<li>The process aligns perfectly with the principle of <strong>lawful beneficial use</strong> confirmed by the courts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By grounding the occupation in demonstrable, technology-enabled activity, VacatAd reduces legal risk and reinforces credibility with both councils and rating surveyors.</p>\n<h2>A smarter way to manage voids</h2>\n<p>Tech-enabled mitigation offers more than compliance &mdash; it streamlines the entire void-management cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faster deployment:</strong> VacatAd's plug-and-play routers can be installed within 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal maintenance:</strong> Systems are remotely monitored, requiring no intrusive site changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio scalability:</strong> Multi-site landlords can manage hundreds of vacant units from a single dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Community benefit:</strong> VacatAd's public Wi-Fi supports local engagement and gives independent retailers affordable advertising exposure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Turning compliance into value</h2>\n<p>By adopting technology-first solutions, landlords gain long-term resilience against both financial and legal uncertainty. Instead of short-term fixes, they achieve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Predictable cost savings</strong> through verified relief entitlement.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved property protection</strong> via live monitoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced reputation</strong> for community contribution and corporate responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<h3>The VacatAd Difference</h3>\n<p>Every installation generates real-time data that demonstrates genuine beneficial occupation. This isn't just about avoiding rates &mdash; it's about creating value for communities while maintaining full legal compliance.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Real-world impact: Case example</h2>\n<p>Consider a portfolio landlord with 15 vacant retail units across the Midlands. Traditional approaches would have required:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual storage arrangements for each property</li>\n<li>Manual documentation and site visits</li>\n<li>Risk of challenge on the legitimacy of occupation</li>\n<li>High administrative overhead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With VacatAd's technology platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All 15 units were operational within one week</li>\n<li>Automated compliance reporting across the entire portfolio</li>\n<li>Demonstrable community benefit through public Wi-Fi provision</li>\n<li>Central dashboard management with real-time monitoring</li>\n<li>Full documentation trail for any authority enquiries</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Looking ahead: The compliance landscape</h2>\n<p>As we move through 2025 and beyond, expect to see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased scrutiny</strong> from local authorities with better data tools</li>\n<li><strong>Higher evidential standards</strong> for claiming beneficial occupation</li>\n<li><strong>Greater emphasis</strong> on community benefit and social value</li>\n<li><strong>Technology integration</strong> as the norm, not the exception</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Property owners who embrace data-driven, transparent solutions now will be well-positioned for whatever regulatory changes lie ahead.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>2025 marks a turning point in rates mitigation. As authorities intensify scrutiny, only solutions grounded in <strong>measurable, legitimate occupation</strong> will endure. VacatAd's data-driven approach provides the transparency, compliance, and operational simplicity landlords need.</p>\n<p>This isn't just smart technology &mdash; it's <strong>the future of responsible property management</strong>.</p>"

    "content": "<p>For commercial asset-owners dealing with void properties, the phrase \"beneficial occupation\" may sound legalistic &mdash; but its meaning has very real financial consequences. Understanding what counts as occupation, what resets relief periods, and how to document compliant use is key. This month we break down the concept, recent case-law and how solutions such as those from VacatAd meet the test in a robust way.</p>\n<h2>What is beneficial occupation?</h2>\n<p>In rating law, for a property to be subject to business rates (i.e., occupied for rating purposes), the occupier must not only physically be in the property but meet several criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>actual occupation;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>exclusive possession or control;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>the occupation must provide some value or benefit</strong> to the occupier; and</li>\n<li><strong>it must not be too transient.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the landmark case <em>R. (on the application of Principled Offsite Logistics Ltd) v Trafford Council (POLL)</em> the court considered whether storage of goods purely to trigger occupation qualified. The judge held that whilst the goods storage had some purpose, the arrangement needed to reflect a genuine use rather than purely rates-avoidance.</p>\n<h2>Why this matters for void properties and rates relief</h2>\n<p>When a property becomes vacant, there is typically a <strong>relief period</strong> (three months for most properties, six months for some industrial units) during which business rates are not payable. However, for the relief period to reset &mdash; i.e., to start afresh after a short occupation and become possible again &mdash; the subsequent occupation must satisfy beneficial occupation criteria.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p><strong>Critical Point:</strong> Many landlords assume that any minimal use will suffice &mdash; but mere token use may not stand up if challenged. For example, one industry article noted that \"token leasing of floors to reset relief may be challenged.\"</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"Business Rates Consultation\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-05-22-beneficial-occupation-explained-what-landlords-need-to-know/image2.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>What counts as a compliant occupation model?</h2>\n<p>A robust occupation model for void units should meet the following practical criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Genuine use of the space</strong> &ndash; Not just placing any items, but activity with purpose (e.g., community usage, connectivity-services).</li>\n<li><strong>Duration</strong> &ndash; The occupation must be long enough to show control and benefit; extremely short leases (e.g., a few days) are unlikely to meet the threshold.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation</strong> &ndash; Lease or licence agreements, evidence of use, installation of service (such as Wi-Fi) help support the case.</li>\n<li><strong>Value/benefit</strong> &ndash; The occupier should derive some benefit (e.g., running services, providing connectivity) and the landlord should not simply be renting a shell for tax reasons only.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By contrast, a purely artificial occupation intended solely to claim a new relief window risks challenge.</p>\n<h2>How VacatAd's model aligns</h2>\n<p>VacatAd positions itself as offering a \"technology-led\" beneficial occupation model. The premise: <strong>install a publicly accessible Wi-Fi hub</strong> in a vacant unit, providing connectivity and local digital advertising. The activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>occupies the unit in a meaningful way (equipment, network, signage)</li>\n<li>delivers community benefit (local advertising, connectivity)</li>\n<li>effectively meets the beneficial occupation test by combining occupancy with value (not just for the sake of avoiding rates)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, rather than a token lease, the model seeks to be defensible and aligned with rating-law principles.</p>\n<img alt=\"VacatAd WiFi Installation\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-05-22-beneficial-occupation-explained-what-landlords-need-to-know/image3.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>Practical checklist for landlords</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review lease/licence duration</strong> &ndash; Aim for at least three months of real occupation to restore relief eligibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the nature of occupation</strong> &ndash; Ask: what activity is done? Does it provide a service or value beyond simply being present?</li>\n<li><strong>Document thoroughly</strong> &ndash; Keep records of connectivity installation, user logs, advertising activity or other operational metrics.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek specialist advice</strong> &ndash; Given that local authorities and rating tribunals may increasingly challenge mitigation strategies, legal and tax-rating advice is prudent.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan ahead</strong> &ndash; Understand when relief will end, when occupation is needed, what documentation you have, and how the property will be used in the interim.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Common pitfalls and how to avoid them</h2>\n<h3>Short-term leases without substance</h3>\n<p>A one-week licence may not satisfy the \"not too transient\" test. Ensure occupation periods are substantial enough to demonstrate genuine use.</p>\n<h3>No real activity</h3>\n<p>If the property is physically occupied but no meaningful use is demonstrated, the authority may treat it as empty. Installation of active services like Wi-Fi demonstrates genuine activity.</p>\n<h3>Poor documentation</h3>\n<p>Without clear leases or evidence of benefit, defending occupation will be harder. Maintain comprehensive records of all occupation activities.</p>\n<h3>Assuming reset is automatic</h3>\n<p>The <strong>13-week reset rule</strong> means that you must plan the 13-week occupation proactively. Simply having a short-term occupier won't automatically trigger a new relief period.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<h3>Case Study Example</h3>\n<p>In the POLL case, the court scrutinised whether storage arrangements constituted genuine beneficial occupation or were merely designed to avoid rates. The key takeaway: <strong>the purpose and substance of the occupation matters</strong>, not just the technical presence of goods or people in the property.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The legal framework in practice</h2>\n<p>Recent developments in rating law have made it clear that local authorities are taking a more robust approach to examining occupation claims. Several key principles have emerged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Substance over form</strong> &ndash; The actual use and purpose matter more than the contractual arrangement alone.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic reality</strong> &ndash; Is there genuine economic benefit or commercial purpose to the occupation?</li>\n<li><strong>Public policy</strong> &ndash; Courts recognise the legitimate interest in preventing purely artificial arrangements designed solely to avoid tax.</li>\n<li><strong>Evidence requirements</strong> &ndash; Comprehensive documentation of actual use, not just contractual entitlement, is increasingly important.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>VacatAd's compliance advantage</h2>\n<p>VacatAd's model addresses each of these concerns directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical installation</strong> &ndash; Equipment is installed and operational, not just theoretical.</li>\n<li><strong>Active service delivery</strong> &ndash; Wi-Fi connectivity is provided to the public, demonstrating genuine use.</li>\n<li><strong>Community benefit</strong> &ndash; Local businesses benefit from advertising, creating real economic value.</li>\n<li><strong>Documented operation</strong> &ndash; Usage metrics, service logs, and advertising records provide clear evidence of beneficial occupation.</li>\n<li><strong>Appropriate duration</strong> &ndash; Installations typically run for sufficient periods to meet the 13-week threshold and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Looking ahead: The evolving landscape</h2>\n<p>As local authorities face continued pressure on their budgets, scrutiny of business rates mitigation strategies is likely to increase. Property owners should expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More frequent challenges to occupation claims</li>\n<li>Greater emphasis on evidence and documentation</li>\n<li>Potentially shorter relief periods in future reforms</li>\n<li>Increased penalties for non-compliant schemes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this environment, having a demonstrably compliant, well-documented occupation strategy is not just good practice &mdash; it's essential protection against financial and legal risk.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Understanding what constitutes beneficial occupation is no longer optional for landlords of vacant commercial property. With rising business-rates burdens and heightened scrutiny, having an occupation model that stands up to challenge is essential.</p>\n<p>For those looking to deploy a compliant, value-adding solution, VacatAd's connectivity-based model offers a strategic route. As you review your portfolio, <strong>align your vacant property strategy with legal precedent and operational reality &mdash; don't leave it to chance</strong>.</p>"

    "content": "<p>In today's challenging market, commercial properties remaining unoccupied are not just idle &mdash; they're a growing liability. For landlords and asset owners, the key cost driver is not only lost rental income but the looming burden of full business rates once the void relief period expires. Understanding how the rules work &mdash; and how compliant solutions such as those offered by VacatAd can help &mdash; is increasingly critical.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the 'empty property' relief window</h2>\n<p>Under the current rules in England, a vacant non-domestic property typically benefits from a <strong>100% relief from business rates for the first three months</strong> of vacancy. After that, full business rates are payable. For industrial and warehouse uses the exemption may extend to six months in some cases. Crucially, for a new three-month relief period to begin after the first one ends, the property must be re-occupied for at least <strong>13 weeks</strong> (i.e., a reset).</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The 13-week reset rule is critical. Without genuine occupation for this period, landlords cannot restart the relief clock and will continue to pay full business rates on empty property.</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"Empty Property Costs Breakdown\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-04-15-the-real-cost-of-vacant-commercial-property-in-2025/image2.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>Why this matters now</h2>\n<p>For many property owners the risk is clear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rents are under pressure</strong>, meaning vacancies may last longer.</li>\n<li><strong>After the relief period expires</strong>, full business rates apply even if the unit remains empty &mdash; meaning a cost with no income.</li>\n<li><strong>Councils and the Valuation Office are increasingly scrutinising</strong> \"mitigation\" strategies and beneficial occupation arguments. For instance, a recent commentary notes that local authorities view short&hyphen;term or token occupation purely to reset relief periods as at risk of being challenged.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As occupancy durations shorten, and market demand weakens, the pressure to adopt compliant, efficient solutions to manage financial burden rises.</p>\n<h2>How compliance and mitigation intersect</h2>\n<p>The concept of <strong>\"beneficial occupation\"</strong> is central here. Under longstanding rating law, for occupation to count (i.e., be rateable), it must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>actual occupation;</li>\n<li>exclusive to the possessor for the purposes of the possessor;</li>\n<li>of benefit to the possessor; and</li>\n<li>not too transient in nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A simplistic \"lease for a few weeks just to restart the clock\" may fail the test if the sole or predominant purpose is rates avoidance rather than a genuine use of the property.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n<p>For landlords of empty units, this means: <strong>any solution involving occupation must be defensible, documented and consistent with the law</strong>. It is here that VacatAd's model &mdash; installing a live-public Wi-Fi node, delivering local advertising, and thereby generating a genuine public benefit and occupation &mdash; positions itself as a compliant strategy rather than a loose workaround.</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"VacatAd Solution Overview\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-04-15-the-real-cost-of-vacant-commercial-property-in-2025/image3.webp\" width=\"800\"/>\n<h2>Practical steps for landlords</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Inventory your void properties</strong> &ndash; Record each site's vacancy start date and relief expiry.</li>\n<li><strong>Understand the reset rule</strong> &ndash; If you aim to take advantage of another relief window, ensure the unit is genuinely occupied for at least 13 weeks and that the occupation is defensible.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess cost vs benefit</strong> &ndash; The cost of business rates for a vacant unit may exceed the cost of installing a compliant occupation solution by some margin.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor local authority stance</strong> &ndash; Some authorities are signalling a tougher approach to mitigation; ensure any strategy is robust, documented and transparent.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider value beyond rates</strong> &ndash; Visibility, community benefit and reputational uplift can accompany compliant occupation schemes &mdash; which aligns with VacatAd's value proposition.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why this is strategic, not just tactical</h2>\n<p>This is not merely a cost-management issue. The presence of long-term vacant property can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>impact asset valuations;</li>\n<li>undermine local high-street vitality (which in turn can influence leasing prospects);</li>\n<li>expose owners to reputational risk and regulatory challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By proactively managing void periods, aligning with legal requirements, and embedding value-adding activities (such as local advertising or community connectivity), property owners can turn a liability into a strategic advantage.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Vacancy on a commercial property no longer simply means \"waiting for the next tenant\". It means navigating a month-by-month cost regime, with business rates easily stacking up once relief periods expire. But with the right approach &mdash; one that respects the principles of beneficial occupation and leverages compliant solutions like VacatAd's connectivity-led model &mdash; the risk can be managed. In 2025, failing to act is not just passive; it's expensive. As landlords and asset owners, <strong>the time to review your vacant-portfolio strategy is now</strong>.</p>"

CBRE&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cbre.co.uk/insights/figures/uk-retail-at-a-glance-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">UK Retail at a Glance Q1 2025</a> notes reduced vacancies in High Streets, Retail Parks, and Shopping Centres, driving rental growth in select markets. Retail Parks lead investment activity, with stable yields reflecting sector resilience. In the office sector, Avison Young reports central London vacancy rates fell to 6.9% in Q3 2024, with take-up 3.2 million sq. ft., a trend expected to persist into 2025 <a href=\"https://www.avisonyoung.co.uk/news-item/-/article/2024/11/13/central-london-office-vacancy-rates-decline-further-as-market-recovery-gains-momentum-in-q3-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Avison Young</a>. Financial and professional services drove 47.4% of leasing activity, signaling robust demand.</p><p class=\"\">For industrial and logistics, Carter Jonas indicates vacancy rates are leveling off, expected to peak in 2025 before declining due to limited new supply and sustained occupier demand <a href=\"https://www.carterjonas.co.uk/insights/commercial-market-outlook-q1-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Carter Jonas</a>. Savills predicts low vacancy rates and above-average rental growth across sectors in 2025, driven by undersupply and business growth <a href=\"https://www.savills.co.uk/blog/article/371033/commercial-property/the-outlook-for-commercial-property-in-2025.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Savills</a>. Despite this recovery, vacancies in secondary locations remain elevated, exposing properties to risks that require proactive management.</p><h2>The Legal and Financial Exposure of Vacant Space</h2><p class=\"\">Vacant commercial properties face multiple threats, each carrying significant financial and legal implications.</p><h3>Squatting Risks</h3><p class=\"\">Squatting in commercial properties is a civil matter in the UK, requiring court orders for eviction, which can take weeks or months and cost landlords upwards of &pound;5,000 in legal fees <a href=\"https://www.clearway.co.uk/news/empty-commercial-property-things-to-consider/\" target=\"_blank\">Clearway</a>. Squatters may cause property damage or, in rare cases, pursue adverse possession claims, complicating recovery. The visible presence of squatters can deter prospective tenants and harm a landlord&rsquo;s reputation.</p><h3>Theft and Vandalism</h3><p class=\"\">Unsecured properties are targets for theft, particularly of valuable materials like copper wiring and HVAC systems. Metal theft costs the UK economy over &pound;500 million annually, with vacant buildings at high risk <a href=\"https://www.clearway.co.uk/news/empty-commercial-property-things-to-consider/\" target=\"_blank\">Clearway</a>. Vandalism, such as graffiti or broken windows, signals neglect, inviting further crime and reducing marketability.</p><h3>Fire and Insurance Liability</h3><p class=\"\">Vacant properties are prone to fire, with arson being the leading cause of commercial fires in the UK. Empty buildings lack regular oversight, increasing vulnerability. Insurance providers classify vacant properties as high-risk, imposing higher premiums or voiding coverage if security conditions (e.g., alarms, inspections) are unmet, leaving landlords exposed to significant losses <a href=\"https://www.clearway.co.uk/news/empty-commercial-property-things-to-consider/\" target=\"_blank\">Clearway</a>.</p><h3>Environmental Damage</h3><p class=\"\">Neglect can lead to water ingress, pest infestations, black mould, or structural degradation from temperature fluctuations. These issues escalate into costly repairs, diminishing a property&rsquo;s value and appeal. Routine maintenance is essential to preserve long-term marketability.</p><h2>A Proactive Security Strategy is Essential</h2><p class=\"\">With declining vacancy rates but persistent risks, landlords must adopt active security protocols to deter intrusion, detect hazards, and demonstrate oversight. These measures support compliance with business rates relief, such as Empty Property Relief (EPR), and insurance requirements, preserving asset value in a recovering market.</p><h3>Best Practice Security Measures</h3><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Remote Monitoring</strong>: Motion-sensitive cameras with night vision and cloud-based feeds provide real-time visibility without on-site staff.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Smart Sensors</strong>: Sensors for humidity, smoke, temperature, and air quality detect issues early, preventing costly damage.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Alarm Systems</strong>: Audible alarms linked to monitoring services deter intruders and alert managers to unauthorized access.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Physical Hardening</strong>: Secure doors, shutters, and anti-climb measures minimize entry points.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Weekly Inspections</strong>: Documented visits ensure early issue detection and provide an audit trail for compliance.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">Even with these measures, a visibly empty property remains vulnerable. Combining security with beneficial occupation addresses this challenge effectively.</p><h2>Turning Security Into Occupation</h2><p class=\"\">Beneficial occupation involves using a property to provide genuine utility, meeting legal criteria for EPR eligibility. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) requires occupation to be actual, beneficial, exclusive, and non-transient, as clarified in the 2018 case <em>R (on the application of Principled Offsite Logistics Ltd) v.

In an economic climate where many high streets and office blocks are struggling with vacancies, the Chancellor&rsquo;s latest announcements have put a spotlight on non-domestic (business) rates, relief schemes, and empty property taxation. <p class=\"\">This post breaks down the key budget changes affecting commercial landlords and occupiers &ndash; from updated reliefs to tougher empty property rules &ndash; and explains why, in this evolving landscape, <strong>VacatAd&rsquo;s</strong><strong>services are more relevant than ever.</strong> Property owners, landlords, commercial agents and facilities managers will find a clear analysis of the Spring Budget measures and what they mean for managing business rates liabilities in 2025.</p><h2>Key Business Rates Changes in Spring Budget&nbsp;2025</h2><p class=\"\">The Spring Budget 2025 continues the government&rsquo;s commitment to reforming the business rates system. While major structural reforms are still on the horizon, several immediate changes and confirmations in this budget will affect how much business rate taxpayers owe and what reliefs they can claim:</p><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (RHL) Relief Tapered:</strong> The budget confirms that the temporary RHL Relief, introduced to support high street businesses in recent years, will continue into 2025/26 but at a reduced level. Eligible occupied retail, hospitality and leisure properties will receive <strong>40% off their business rates bills (up to a &pound;110,000 cap)</strong> for 2025/26 (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=In%20the%20Autumn%20Budget%2C%20the,with%20a%20%C2%A3110%2C000%20cap\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>) (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/business-rates-relief-202526-retail-hospitality-and-leisure-scheme#:~:text=ratepayers%20will%20receive%2040,maximum%20cash%20cap%20of%20%C2%A3110%2C000\"> Business Rates Relief: 2025/26 Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Scheme - GOV.UK </a>). This is a drop from the 75% relief available in 2024/25 (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/business-rates-relief-202425-retail-hospitality-and-leisure-scheme#:~:text=match%20at%20L546%20eligible%20ratepayers,maximum%20cash%20cap%20of%20%C2%A3110%2C000\"> Business Rates Relief: 2024/25 Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Scheme - GOV.UK </a>), indicating that government support for these sectors is tapering down as the economy normalises. RHL businesses therefore need to budget for a larger rates bill (60% of the normal charge, versus only 25% last year).</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Multiplier Freeze for Small Businesses:</strong> To further support smaller properties and the high street, the Chancellor has frozen the small business rates multiplier for 2025/26 (<a href=\"https://www.mills-reeve.com/publications/autumn-budget-2024-business-rates/#:~:text=to%20capture%20large%20distribution%20warehouses,those%20owned%20by%20%E2%80%9Conline%20giants%E2%80%9D\">Autumn Budget 2024: Business Rates | Mills &amp; Reeve</a>). Freezing the multiplier (the rate in the pound used to calculate rates bills) helps limit increases in bills that would otherwise occur due to inflation. This move keeps bills more manageable for smaller firms. (It&rsquo;s worth noting that larger properties above certain rateable values may not enjoy this freeze and could even see higher multipliers in future as part of a rebalancing &ndash; more on that below.)</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Future Reforms on the Horizon:</strong> Importantly, the Spring Budget reiterated a commitment to overhaul the business rates system to better support the high street and drive investment (<a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/spring-statement-2025-day-factual-briefing#:~:text=The%20Chancellor%20announced%20that%20at,63\">Spring Statement 2025: On-the-day factual briefing | Local Government Association</a>). An interim report on business rates reform is expected in summer 2025, with more detailed policy changes to be unveiled by the Autumn Budget 2025 (<a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/parliament/briefings-and-responses/spring-statement-2025-day-factual-briefing#:~:text=The%20Chancellor%20announced%20that%20at,63\">Spring Statement 2025: On-the-day factual briefing | Local Government Association</a>). Among the ideas being discussed are <strong>permanently lower tax rates for smaller businesses and high-street properties, funded by higher rates for large &ldquo;online&rdquo; warehouses</strong>, as well as more frequent property revaluations and digitalising the system (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=The%20Labour%20government%20plans%20to,increasing%20the%20frequency%20of%20revaluations\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>). While these longer-term reforms won&rsquo;t kick in immediately, the direction of travel is clear &ndash; the system is aiming to become fairer and more responsive, albeit within the constraint that it must still raise the same revenue overall (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=The%20government%20plans%20to%20replace,2028%20for%20better%20data%20sharing\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>). For now, though, property owners must navigate the current rules, including some recent changes that have already come into effect from last year&rsquo;s budget.</p></li></ul><h2>The 92-Day Occupation Rule for Empty Properties</h2><p class=\"\">Perhaps the most significant change affecting commercial landlords is the new <strong>empty property rates rule</strong> that took effect from 1 April 2024 (as a result of last year&rsquo;s Spring Budget) and continues to shape 2025. <strong>Business premises must now be re-occupied for at least 13 weeks (around 92 days) in order to qualify for a fresh period of empty property rates relief</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=In%20the%20Spring%20Budget%2C%20the,that%20period%20of%20occupation%20ends\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). Previously, a short occupation of just 6 weeks was sufficient to reset the clock.</p><p class=\"\">This rule matters because of how empty property rates relief works. When a commercial property becomes vacant, landlords are usually exempt from business rates for an initial period &ndash; generally 3 months for offices/shops and 6 months for industrial/warehouse properties (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=Landlords%20can%20claim%20Empty%20Property,up%20to%20three%2Fsix%20months%20again\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). After that, full rates become payable even while the property lies empty. Under the old rules, if the landlord could secure any tenant or occupation for at least six weeks, that short occupation would &ldquo;reset&rdquo; the relief &ndash; effectively granting a further 3 or 6 month exemption once the property was empty again (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=Landlords%20can%20claim%20Empty%20Property,up%20to%20three%2Fsix%20months%20again\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). Many savvy landlords engaged in this practice of intermittent short lettings to continually refresh their relief.</p><p class=\"\">The government saw this <strong>&ldquo;6-week relief reset&rdquo;</strong> tactic &ndash; often dubbed <em>&ldquo;box shifting&rdquo;</em> &ndash; as an abuse of the system and moved to clamp down on it (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20intention%20here%20is,the%20period%20of%20the%20tenancy\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). Companies would take short-term lets of vacant properties, sometimes just storing nominal items (hence &ldquo;boxes&rdquo;), to help the owner avoid empty rates (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20intention%20here%20is,the%20period%20of%20the%20tenancy\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). Now, however, the bar has been raised: an empty property must be occupied for at least 13 weeks before the owner can claim a new cycle of empty property relief (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=In%20the%20Spring%20Budget%2C%20the,that%20period%20of%20occupation%20ends\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). In other words, a landlord has to bear at least three months of rates payments (or have a tenant pay them) before earning another rates-free period. This <strong>92-day occupation threshold</strong> aims to discourage repetitive short-term occupancy arrangements purely for tax mitigation.</p><p class=\"\">From a landlord&rsquo;s perspective, this is a game-changer. The traditional quick fix of a token 6-week tenancy to cut your losses is no longer available. <strong>Intermittent occupation schemes now require a much longer commitment</strong>, which can be harder to arrange and may reduce the appeal of pop-up shops or short-term licenses. Indeed, there are concerns in the retail sector that this change could deter landlords from offering space to pop-up operators (who typically want shorter stints), potentially removing the vibrancy these temporary shops bring (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=While%20some%20landlords%20have%20been,for%20at%20least%2013%20weeks\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). The intention was to curb avoidance, but it may also mean some space stays empty longer if landlords hold out for a tenant willing to take at least a 3-month lease.</p><h2>Empty Property Taxation &ndash; Pressure on Landlords</h2><p class=\"\">By extending the required occupation period to 13 weeks, the government is effectively tightening what some call the &ldquo;empty property tax.&rdquo; Landlords already grappling with high vacancy rates now face the prospect of <strong>paying full business rates on empty properties for longer periods of time</strong>, unless they can secure qualifying occupiers. This change &ldquo;will significantly add to the financial burden on landlords already facing a multitude of pressures,&rdquo; as one real estate law analysis noted (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=This%20change%20will%20significantly%20add,result%20of%20this%20Budget%20change\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). Those pressures include an uncertain economic environment in which tenants are struggling: a planned increase in the business rates multiplier (linked to inflation) in April 2024 was forecast to <strong>push more tenants into insolvency, resulting in even more empty commercial properties</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=This%20change%20will%20significantly%20add,result%20of%20this%20Budget%20change\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). In short, many landlords may find themselves with no tenant, no rental income, and now a hefty rates bill to pay with fewer ways to lighten the load.</p><p class=\"\">It&rsquo;s not just retail high streets feeling the pinch. Office and industrial landlords too are seeing cost challenges. Business rates have become a <strong>significant problem alongside other costs</strong> for property owners and occupiers, contributing to older offices being closed or even demolished in some cases (<a href=\"https://www.rics.org/content/dam/ricsglobal/documents/market-surveys/global-commercial-property-monitors/Q4-2024-RICS-UK-Commercial-Property-Monitor.pdf#:~:text=Chartered%20Surveyors%2C%20davidambrose%40mail.com%20,line%20shopping\">Q4 2024 RICS UK Commercial Propety Monitor.indd</a>). When properties go vacant, owners must quickly decide whether to shoulder the ongoing rates or seek some form of relief. With the new 92-day rule, some may attempt to avoid the tax by holding properties vacant longer (waiting for a suitable tenant) rather than engaging in short lettings that don&rsquo;t meet the threshold. Others might explore more <strong>creative solutions to mitigate empty rates</strong> within the law. This is where expert help becomes crucial.</p><h2>Maximising Reliefs and Navigating New Rules</h2><p class=\"\">Despite the challenges, the current policy landscape isn&rsquo;t all doom and gloom &ndash; there are still <strong>opportunities to maximise business rates reliefs</strong> and strategies to manage liabilities, if one is proactive and well-advised. The Spring Budget 2025 and recent reforms offer a mix of sticks and carrots for ratepayers:</p><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Take Advantage of Available Relief Schemes:</strong> Make sure you are claiming all eligible reliefs. For example, small properties might qualify for <strong>Small Business Rate Relief</strong>, which can reduce or eliminate the rates bill if the rateable value is below certain thresholds. Likewise, if your property is in retail, hospitality or leisure use, <strong>claim the 40% RHL Relief for 2025/26</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=In%20the%20Autumn%20Budget%2C%20the,with%20a%20%C2%A3110%2C000%20cap\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>) &ndash; it&rsquo;s automatically applied by councils but ensure it&rsquo;s reflected in your bill. There&rsquo;s also an <strong>Improvement Relief</strong> in place (introduced in 2023) which means if you&rsquo;ve made qualifying improvements to your property (such as expansions or upgrades), the resultant increase in rateable value can be ignored for up to 12 months &ndash; effectively delaying a higher bill and encouraging investment. And if your property is <strong>listed or in a specific Enterprise Zone</strong>, additional reliefs or exemptions might apply. In short, now is the time to audit your portfolio for any and all reliefs available.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Plan Vacant Periods Strategically:</strong> With the <strong>13-week occupation rule</strong> now in force, property owners need to be more strategic about how they handle vacancies. If you know a property might be empty for an extended period, consider arranging a <strong>short-term occupation that lasts at least 3 months</strong> to reset the relief clock. This could be through a flexible lease or license to a business that needs temporary space, or even partnering with a charity or community organisation to use the space (charitable use can confer 80% relief in itself, and still count as occupied). The key is to plan these occupancies carefully so they meet the new threshold and serve a real purpose. The days of shuffling empty boxes in a warehouse for six weeks are over &ndash; any interim use now needs to be a bit more substantive and sustained.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Monitor Revaluations and Appeals:</strong> Business property values were revalued in 2023, and the next revaluation is slated for 2026 under the new three-year cycle. However, the government signalled it may increase the frequency of revaluations, possibly moving to annual revaluations in the future to keep rates more aligned with current market conditions (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=The%20government%20plans%20to%20replace,2028%20for%20better%20data%20sharing\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>). Stay on top of your properties&rsquo; rateable values &ndash; if you believe a valuation is too high (for instance, if the local market has declined or the property has downsides not accounted for), consider lodging a challenge through the &ldquo;Check, Challenge, Appeal&rdquo; system. Also note any physical changes to the property or its locale that might warrant a reassessment. A lower rateable value will mean a lower bill each year going forward.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Prepare for Compliance Changes:</strong> The government is looking at modernising rates administration by 2028, including a potential <strong>&ldquo;duty to notify&rdquo; system requiring ratepayers to report changes</strong> (like occupancy status) more promptly (<a href=\"https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/business-rates-reform-autumn-budget-2024#:~:text=The%20government%20plans%20to%20replace,2028%20for%20better%20data%20sharing\">Business rates reform: Autumn Budget 2024 | Tax Adviser</a>). This goes hand-in-hand with possible anti-avoidance measures such as a General Anti-Avoidance Rule for business rates (<a href=\"https://www.mills-reeve.com/publications/autumn-budget-2024-business-rates/#:~:text=,and%20valuations%20coming%20into%20effect\">Autumn Budget 2024: Business Rates | Mills &amp; Reeve</a>). Landlords and agents should be prepared for closer scrutiny of relief claims and occupancy patterns. In practice, this means ensuring that any relief or exemption you claim is solidly justified and documented. Using legitimate strategies (such as genuine short-term occupiers or charitable lets) is fine, but everything should be above board because councils will have more tools to clamp down on abuse.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">In summary, property owners can still <strong>minimise their business rates burden</strong> by being proactive &ndash; claiming the reliefs they&rsquo;re entitled to, structuring leases or licenses smartly, and complying with the new rules. It has become a more complex playing field, which is why expert advice is invaluable in identifying the best course of action for each property.</p><h2>Why VacatAd&rsquo;s Services Are More Relevant Than Ever</h2><p class=\"\">With the Spring Budget 2025 reinforcing these changes, <strong>VacatAd</strong> finds its mission &ndash; helping clients reduce their business rates through strategic temporary occupation &ndash; more critical than ever. In this new landscape, landlords and property managers are facing a perfect storm: <strong>higher holding costs on empty properties</strong>, reduced government relief support, and stricter rules around how reliefs can be claimed. VacatAd specializes in navigating this storm on your behalf.</p><p class=\"\">Our team at VacatAd has deep expertise in the business rates field, and we&rsquo;ve adapted quickly to the <strong>92-day occupation rule</strong>. We arrange compliant, meaningful short-term occupations of vacant commercial space that satisfy the 13-week requirement, resetting your empty property relief in a lawful manner (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=In%20the%20Spring%20Budget%2C%20the,that%20period%20of%20occupation%20ends\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>). This isn&rsquo;t about loopholes or gimmicks &ndash; it&rsquo;s about <strong>finding win-win temporary uses</strong> for your property that both mitigate your rates bill and bring some activity to an otherwise idle space. Whether it&rsquo;s coordinating with pop-up retail operators, seasonal businesses, or community initiatives, we ensure that the occupation is genuine and beneficial, keeping you on the right side of HM Treasury&rsquo;s anti-avoidance intentions (<a href=\"https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/real-estate-law-blog/spring-budget-analysis-changes-to-empty-property-relief-will-put-further-financial-pressure-on-landlords#:~:text=The%20Government%E2%80%99s%20intention%20here%20is,the%20period%20of%20the%20tenancy\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords. | Real Estate Law Blog | Kingsley Napley</a>).</p><p class=\"\">Beyond the empty rates reset, VacatAd also advises on maximising other reliefs. Unsure if your property qualifies for a specific relief or exemption? We can conduct a thorough audit and handle the application process. Overwhelmed by the prospect of dealing with council billing departments or the paperwork for temporary lets? We take that burden off your shoulders. The Spring Budget&rsquo;s message was clear: <strong>business rates are evolving, and only those who proactively manage their liabilities will avoid unnecessary costs</strong>. VacatAd serves as your partner in this process, keeping you ahead of changes. As one of the specialist companies in this niche, we understand the fine print of rating law and the practical steps needed to achieve savings for our clients, ethically and effectively.</p><p class=\"\">Crucially, our approach recognises the financial pressures you&rsquo;re under. Every month that a commercial unit lies empty is a hit to your bottom line &ndash; and now, with longer mandatory occupation periods, the stakes are even higher. VacatAd&rsquo;s strategic interventions can mean the difference between a property remaining a <strong>monthly expense vs. becoming a breakeven or even revenue-generating asset</strong> while you search for a long-term tenant. By engaging us, landlords can relieve themselves of the stress of mounting business rate bills on voids, and occupiers (like retailers who only need short-term space) can benefit from flexible arrangements. It&rsquo;s a solution that creates value on both ends.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class=\"\">In conclusion, the Spring Budget 2025 has brought <strong>significant changes to business rates</strong> that property stakeholders cannot afford to ignore.

    "content": "<div>Vacant commercial properties in the UK can become expensive burdens for landlords. Owners of empty shops, offices, or warehouses remain liable for business rates&mdash;a tax on property occupancy&mdash;even when there is no rental income. Across the sector, this adds up to over <strong>&pound;1.3 billion a year in business rates paid by landlords</strong> on vacant commercial units. Recent rule changes have made obtaining relief harder, increasing the financial strain. However, a new technology-based approach from <strong>VacatAd</strong><strong>offers a legal way to reduce costs.</strong> By creating short-term occupations using plug-and-play devices (such as Wi-Fi routers, motion-sensitive cameras, and remote sensors), <strong>VacatAd helps owners stay within the law</strong> while significantly cutting business rates on vacant premises.<h2><strong>Vacant Commercial Properties and Business Rates: A Practical Guide to VacatAd&rsquo;s Compliant 92-Day Occupation Solution</strong></h2><p class=\"\">This blog post explains how VacatAd&rsquo;s system meets the latest regulations, how it differs from tax avoidance schemes, and how it protects properties and benefits the wider community. If you are a commercial landlord, asset manager, or property adviser, you will find practical information on how to lawfully reduce rates on an empty property, keep the building maintained, and gain peace of mind&mdash;without making long-term commitments. We will also touch on trends in business rates relief and conclude with details on how to get a free consultation to see what VacatAd can do for you.</p><h2>The New 92-Day Occupation Rule: What It Is and Why It Matters</h2><p class=\"\">The Spring Budget 2024 introduced a significant change: from 1 April 2024, any empty commercial property must be reoccupied for at least three months (around 92 days) to qualify for a new period of business rates relief. This is an increase from the previous requirement of six weeks. In practical terms, a six-week tenancy no longer resets your empty property relief; a minimum of 92 days is now needed.</p><p class=\"\">This rule was introduced to discourage a practice known as &ldquo;box shifting,&rdquo; where some landlords let empty buildings for six-week periods to secure a short-term occupancy, then claimed the three- or six-month empty rates exemption, and repeated the cycle. Although not illegal, it was considered an abuse of the rules. By requiring a full three months of occupation, the government aims to curb these rapid cycles and encourage more substantial short-term uses of vacant properties.</p><p class=\"\">For landlords, the 92-day rule is a double-edged sword. It pushes owners to find more meaningful short-term occupants but also means that properties lying empty for longer are subject to full business rates, with fewer chances to reset relief. This has come at a time when landlords already face difficulties from rising vacancy rates, economic uncertainty, and tenants going out of business. Experts warn it will increase costs for landlords, making it more important to adopt new strategies to minimise the impact (<a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=de041308-505a-4d7d-b232-3bdd03564d52\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Budget analysis: changes to Empty Property Relief will put further financial pressure on landlords &ndash; Lexology</a>).</p><h2>VacatAd&rsquo;s Technology-First Solution for Vacant Rates Relief</h2><p class=\"\"><strong>VacatAd</strong> was formed to provide a compliant way for landlords to reduce rates on vacant properties under the new rules. The key is having a legitimate 92-day occupation that meets the legal tests for <em>&ldquo;rateable occupation.&rdquo;</em> VacatAd achieves this through a technology-based occupancy model that requires very little effort from landlords.</p><p class=\"\">VacatAd takes a short-term lease (just over three months) and installs smart equipment&mdash;plug-and-play Wi-Fi routers, security cameras, and sensors&mdash;on site. The property is digitally active: VacatAd is the occupier of record and runs its equipment for at least 92 days, satisfying the beneficial use requirement. Once VacatAd leaves, the property becomes empty again, and the landlord can claim a new period of empty rates relief (three or six months, as allowed by law).</p><p class=\"\">During the occupation, VacatAd pays the business rates (as part of its service) and deals with all council notifications and evidence. Wi-Fi logs, sensor data, and council inspections verify that the occupation is genuine. At the end of the tenancy, VacatAd removes its devices, restores the property to its prior condition, and informs the council that it is now empty. The owner then qualifies for a fresh round of relief. This entire process is designed to meet legal requirements and avoid any suggestion of a &ldquo;sham&rdquo; arrangement.</p><h4>VacatAd&rsquo;s technology-based approach has several advantages:</h4><ol><li><p class=\"\"><strong>No disruption to the property</strong>: The devices are plug-and-play and require only a power socket. No alterations or fit-outs are needed, and the equipment is removed quickly when the lease ends.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Minimal paperwork for landlords</strong>: VacatAd manages council communications, billing, and compliance. The landlord simply grants a short lease and receives regular updates.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Rapid deployment</strong>: Equipment can typically be installed and activated within days, with council notifications made immediately.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Flexibility for reoccupation</strong>: Once a new tenant is found, VacatAd leaves in under 24 hours, freeing the space with no long notice periods or disruptions. If the building remains vacant, VacatAd can be brought back for another occupancy period.</p></li></ol><p class=\"\">These features help landlords lawfully avoid paying large sums in empty rates while maintaining transparency with local authorities. VacatAd&rsquo;s methods reflect established legal precedents around minimal occupations (such as the Makro case), ensuring the occupation stands up to scrutiny (<a href=\"https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/insight/latest-high-court-ruling-on-empty-rates-mitigation-case/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest High Court ruling on empty rates&rsquo; mitigation case &ndash; Place North West</a>).</p><h2>Why Compliance Is Key: Avoiding Risky &ldquo;Rates Mitigation&rdquo; Schemes</h2><p class=\"\">Over the years, various questionable schemes have claimed to lower empty rates bills but often involved creating the <em>illusion</em> of occupation. Local authorities are now cracking down on these arrangements, and landlords can face serious financial and legal consequences if a scheme is deemed a sham. Below are a few tactics that have proven risky:</p><ol><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Shell Companies and Liquidation</strong>: In this setup, an empty unit is leased to a newly created company that soon dissolves, leaving unpaid rates. Courts now look through these arrangements, and landlords can end up liable for backdated rates plus penalties (<a href=\"https://veritygroup.uk/rates-mitigation-schemes/\" target=\"_blank\">From Snail Farming to &lsquo;Property Guardians&rsquo;: Rates Mitigation Gone Wrong &ndash; Verity Management Services</a>).</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Token Agriculture Schemes (e.g. &ldquo;Snail Farms&rdquo;)</strong>: Some landlords have claimed an agricultural exemption by placing a few crates of snails in an office, calling it a &ldquo;snail farm.&rdquo; Councils have successfully challenged these moves, leading to backdated rates bills, legal costs, and reputational damage (<a href=\"https://www.hartbrown.co.uk/latest-news/snail-farm-scam-landlord-forced-back-into-their-shell/#:~:text=The%20latest%20incident%20centred%20on,agreement%20of%20the%20property%20owner.\" target=\"_blank\">Snail farm scam | Commercial Property | Hart Brown Solicitors</a>).</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Bogus Charitable Occupation</strong>: Charities can qualify for up to 80% or 100% relief. Some arrangements involve installing a charity in name only, with little real activity on-site. Councils and the Charity Commission are now vigilant in cracking down on such arrangements (<a href=\"https://www.anthonycollins.com/insights/ebriefings/charities-given-warning-on-business-rates-avoidance/\" target=\"_blank\">Charities given warning on business rates avoidance &ndash; Anthony Collins Solicitors</a>).</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Fake Places of Worship</strong>: Another avoidance tactic is to claim a vacant property is used as a church or prayer room, often with minimal actual worship. Councils have disputed these claims, leading to legal battles and large backdated bills (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/23/ye-of-little-faith-the-tax-loophole-that-turns-old-pubs-into-places-of-worship\" target=\"_blank\">Ye of little faith? The tax loophole that turns old pubs into places of worship &ndash; The Guardian</a>).</p></li></ol><p class=\"\">Schemes that only create a superficial appearance of occupation carry high risks and can result in retroactive charges, penalties, and reputational harm. VacatAd&rsquo;s approach, on the other hand, is transparent. It occupies the property, pays the relevant rates during the tenancy, and openly communicates with councils. Because the use (free Wi-Fi and security monitoring) is clearly beneficial, it is more resistant to legal challenges. To date, VacatAd has a 100% success rate and supports over 100 properties across more than 20 local authorities&mdash;no council objections to our data logs have arisen.</p><h2>Protecting Your Property: Security, Maintenance, and Peace of Mind</h2><p class=\"\">Leaving a property empty raises the risk of vandalism, squatting, and deterioration. In contrast, VacatAd&rsquo;s occupation serves as a protective measure:</p></div><img alt=\"VacatAd technology solution for vacant properties\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-02-17-in-depth-analysis-legally-reducing-business-rates-on-vacant-property-vacatads-techfirst-solution/image2.webp\" width=\"800\"/><div>Live-in property guardians have sometimes been used to protect vacant sites, but they bring obligations around living conditions, notice periods, and potential complications when it is time to reoccupy. <strong>VacatAd&rsquo;s system does not involve onsite residents and can vacate within 24 hours,</strong><strong>leaving the property available for a commercial tenant at short notice.</strong></div><img alt=\"Property security and monitoring system\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/25-02-17-in-depth-analysis-legally-reducing-business-rates-on-vacant-property-vacatads-techfirst-solution/image3.webp\" width=\"800\"/><div>Trends and Outlook: Business Rates Relief in a Challenging Market<p class=\"\">The property market in 2025 remains challenging. Higher interest rates, changing work patterns (such as remote working), and increasing online shopping have led to many vacant commercial units. Business rates continue to apply after a short grace period, creating financial pressure on landlords who are not collecting rent. Meanwhile, local councils have ramped up their enforcement efforts against questionable rates mitigation practices.</p><p class=\"\">The new 92-day rule reflects the government&rsquo;s intention to curtail quick resets of empty property relief and push for more meaningful occupation. As a result, property owners who rely on six-week pop-ups or purely nominal uses to reduce rates may find those approaches outdated. VacatAd&rsquo;s solution fits neatly into the stricter regulatory environment, as it provides a genuine three-month occupation through legitimate, technology-based services. This model is increasingly seen as a straightforward and safer option to mitigate rates without risking legal complications.</p><h2>Conclusion: Compliance, Savings, and Peace of Mind&mdash;Get Your Free Consultation</h2><p class=\"\">Empty property business rates need not be an unavoidable loss. <strong>VacatAd</strong> offers a fully compliant way to achieve genuine occupation for the required period, leading to significant reductions in empty rates while avoiding the pitfalls of dubious schemes. The service provides 24/7 monitoring, protects your building, and maintains a flexible timetable so you can accommodate new tenants with minimal delay.</p><p class=\"\">If you have a vacant commercial property, this is a practical way to lighten your rates burden and keep the asset secure.

    "content": "<div>Business rates are a crucial consideration for commercial property occupiers in the UK. Understanding their complexities can empower businesses to manage these expenses more effectively. This comprehensive guide covers the essentials of business rates, calculations, billing cycles, relief options, strategic cost-saving measures, and useful considerations for businesses.<h2>What Are Business Rates?</h2><p class=\"\">Business rates, also known as non-domestic rates, are a tax levied on the occupation of commercial properties, such as offices, retail premises, industrial spaces, and warehouses. Collected by local councils, they help fund public services such as education, policing, and waste management.</p><h2>Who Pays Business Rates?</h2><p class=\"\">Businesses and organisations occupying commercial premises must typically pay business rates. Exceptions include agricultural land and buildings, religious properties, and certain charity-operated facilities.</p><h2>Calculating Business Rates</h2><p class=\"\">Understanding how your business rates are calculated is essential:</p><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Rateable Value (RV)</strong>: Determined by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), the RV represents the estimated rental value of the property at a given valuation date. The VOA regularly updates valuations, typically every five years, though this cycle can vary due to legislative changes.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Rates Multiplier (Poundage)</strong>: Annually set by the government, the multiplier represents the tax payable per pound of RV. Different multipliers exist for small businesses and larger businesses.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p class=\"\"><em>The calculation:</em></p></blockquote><p class=\"sqsrte-large\">Business Rates Liability = Rateable Value &times; Rates Multiplier </p><h2>Understanding the Billing Cycle</h2><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Annual Cycle</strong>: Business rates are billed annually, with the tax year running from 1 April to 31 March.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Payment Options</strong>: Typically, payments are spread over ten monthly instalments. However, businesses can request a 12-month payment cycle from their local council.</p></li></ul><h2>Relief and Exemptions</h2><p class=\"\">There are several relief schemes that can significantly reduce business rates liability:</p><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Small Business Rate Relief (SBRR)</strong>: Provides relief to small businesses occupying premises with lower RVs. Businesses with an RV below a certain threshold may receive substantial or full relief.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Retail, Hospitality, and Leisure Relief</strong>: Special relief schemes often introduced temporarily (especially in response to economic downturns or crises like the COVID-19 pandemic).</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Charitable Relief</strong>: Charities and registered community amateur sports clubs may receive mandatory and discretionary reliefs.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Rural Rate Relief</strong>: Specific properties located in designated rural areas may qualify for additional rate relief.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Empty Property Relief</strong>: Commercial properties unoccupied for the first three months (or longer for industrial properties) typically qualify for empty property relief, exempting them from rates during this initial vacancy period.</p></li></ul><h2>Strategic Occupation for Savings</h2><p class=\"\">Recent regulatory adjustments have significantly impacted empty property relief. From 1 April 2024, commercial properties must now be occupied continuously for at least 92 days to reset the exemption cycle. This allows another 92-day rate-free period upon the subsequent vacancy.</p><p class=\"\">Businesses that strategically manage periods of occupation and vacancy&mdash;such as occupying premises temporarily for storage or operational purposes&mdash;can significantly reduce their rates liabilities over time, often achieving approximately 50% savings. Specialised firms, like VacatAd, assist clients in navigating these regulatory complexities to optimise savings.</p><h2>Appeals and Valuation Disputes</h2><p class=\"\">Businesses can challenge their property's RV through the \"Check, Challenge, Appeal\" process provided by the VOA if they believe their valuation is incorrect or unfair. Engaging with a qualified rating surveyor can greatly improve your chances of successfully appealing a rateable value.</p><h2>Important Considerations</h2><ul><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Local Variations</strong>: Policies on discretionary reliefs, exemptions, and processes can vary significantly by local council.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Regulatory Updates</strong>: Staying informed of legislative changes and local policy adjustments is crucial. Councils often review relief eligibility and billing procedures annually.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Professional Advice</strong>: Consult business rate advisors or chartered surveyors specialising in business rates to ensure accuracy and optimise savings.</p></li></ul><h2>Preparing for Future Changes</h2><p class=\"\">Regular reviews of your business rates obligations, monitoring legislative developments, and engaging proactively with professional advisors can help businesses manage costs effectively over time.</p><p class=\"\">Managing business rates effectively requires understanding their complexities, staying informed about regulatory changes, and strategically planning property occupation and use. With careful attention and professional guidance, businesses can significantly optimise their rates expenditure.</p></div><hr/><div>Speak to one of our experts today</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "<div>A recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9904dz73pyo\" target=\"_blank\">BBC report </a>on a Liverpool office building turned snail farm has highlighted a controversial practice in business rates mitigation that is drawing scrutiny from both local authorities and legal experts. The case involves a company using an unconventional snail farming operation to claim agricultural exemptions on business rates, sparking a debate over the legality and ethics of such schemes. As businesses look for ways to reduce their financial burdens, it&rsquo;s important to differentiate between legitimate solutions like Vacatad's technology-first approach and questionable tactics that could lead to legal complications.<h2>The Snail Farm Controversy: A Case of Tax Avoidance?</h2><p class=\"\">The situation in Liverpool revolves around 15 crates of snails, each containing as few as two snails, being stored in an office building. The company involved, Snai1 Primary Products 2023 Ltd, claims that this constitutes a legitimate agricultural operation, which could exempt the property from business rates. However, this tactic has raised suspicions among local authorities, who view it as a potential scheme for tax avoidance rather than a bona fide business activity BBC News.</p><p class=\"\">The legality of such operations hinges on whether the use of the property can genuinely be classified as agricultural. In the UK, agricultural land and buildings are generally exempt from business rates under the Local Government Finance Act 1988. However, the courts have previously ruled against similar schemes. In 2021, the High Court deemed a snail farm tenancy deal involving the same individuals as a \"sham,\" specifically designed to avoid paying business rates BBC News.</p><h2>Understanding the Legal Landscape: Agriculture and Marketing Properties</h2><p class=\"\">Under UK law, properties used for agricultural purposes are indeed eligible for business rates relief. However, the definition of \"agricultural use\" is strict, and any attempt to exploit this for purposes that do not genuinely align with agricultural activities can be legally challenged. The courts have consistently ruled against schemes where the primary intent is to avoid business rates rather than engage in legitimate farming.</p><p class=\"\">The use of properties for marketing purposes&mdash;such as displaying adverts or temporary occupations&mdash;does not typically qualify for agricultural exemptions. This is because marketing does not meet the statutory definition of agricultural use, which generally involves the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals in sufficient quantities to constitute a business.</p><h2>How Vacatad&rsquo;s Approach Differs</h2><p class=\"\">In stark contrast to the questionable practices seen in the Liverpool snail farm case, Vacatad offers a technology-first, legally sound solution for business rates mitigation. Unlike schemes that rely on tenuous claims of agricultural use, Vacatad focuses on providing genuine occupancy solutions that align with both the letter and the spirit of the law.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>1. Beneficial Occupation</strong>: Vacatad temporarily occupies vacant commercial properties using advanced technology to create public Wi-Fi networks and advertising spaces. This occupation qualifies the property for business rates relief under \"beneficial occupation\" status&mdash;a legally recognised and court-backed method that ensures compliance with all regulations.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>2. Transparency and Compliance</strong>: Vacatad&rsquo;s operations are fully transparent and designed to withstand scrutiny. The company takes charge of all interactions with local authorities, ensuring that all processes are compliant with the latest legal requirements. This is in stark contrast to the practices of companies like Snai1 Primary Products, where the primary goal appears to be avoiding rates through dubious means.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>3. Community Engagement</strong>: Vacatad&rsquo;s model also benefits the local community by providing free internet access and supporting small businesses through targeted advertising. This dual impact not only makes a positive contribution to the local economy but also provides a tangible, lawful use of the property, reinforcing its legitimacy.</p><h2>Conclusion: Choosing the Right Path in Business Rates Mitigation</h2><p class=\"\">As local authorities increase their scrutiny of business rates mitigation schemes, it&rsquo;s crucial for property owners and businesses to choose solutions that are both effective and legally sound. The case of the Liverpool snail farm serves as a cautionary tale of what can happen when companies attempt to exploit legal grey areas for tax avoidance.</p><p class=\"\">Vacatad offers a robust alternative that not only helps businesses save on rates but also adheres to all legal requirements, ensuring peace of mind for property owners. By focusing on beneficial occupation and community engagement, Vacatad demonstrates that it is possible to achieve significant savings without resorting to questionable practices.</p><p class=\"\">For businesses looking to mitigate business rates legally and ethically, Vacatad is the clear choice. </p></div><div>Speak to the team today</div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"600px\" src=\"https://vacatad.pipedrive.com/scheduler/2rdW57uq/vacatad-introductory-call\" title=\"Pipedrive Scheduler Embed\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Once-bustling high streets are now shadowed by increasing vacancy rates, with commercial properties left empty as businesses either pivot to remote working or succumb to the economic pressures of the past few years. Unfortunately, these vacant spaces have become targets for criminal activities, notably the industrial-scale farming of cannabis by organised crime groups.<p class=\"\">Recent reports from law enforcement agencies paint a concerning picture: <strong>criminal gangs are exploiting abandoned shops, offices, and even former pubs and bingo halls to establish vast cannabis farms</strong>. With footfall in town centres significantly reduced, especially in the evenings, these illicit operations often go unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late. This troubling trend is symptomatic of the broader economic and social shifts brought about by the pandemic, highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions to protect vacant properties (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2x0x6ypgneo.amp\" target=\"_blank\">BBC News</a>).</p><h2>The Growing Threat to Vacant Properties</h2><p class=\"\">As commercial properties lie empty, they are increasingly at risk of being repurposed for illegal activities. In Newport, South Wales, for example, criminals used several floors of an abandoned department store to grow more than 3,000 cannabis plants. <strong>The street value of these drugs was estimated at &pound;2 million</strong>, underscoring the scale of the problem. This isn&rsquo;t an isolated incident; similar cases have been reported across the UK, from Scotland to Wales, revealing a nationwide issue that property owners cannot afford to ignore (<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/09/cannabis-farms-abandoned-shops-pubs-drug-gangs-police/\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a>).</p><p class=\"\">The underlying causes of this phenomenon are multifaceted. <strong>The decline in high street activity, driven by a combination of increased home-working and reduced consumer spending, has left many commercial properties without tenants</strong>. This lack of occupancy creates a vacuum that criminal enterprises are all too eager to fill. Furthermore, with fewer people frequenting these areas, the usual signs of illegal activity&mdash;such as taped-up windows or bright lights during the night&mdash;are less likely to be noticed, allowing these operations to flourish (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2x0x6ypgneo.amp\" target=\"_blank\">BBC News</a>).</p><h2>Turning the Tide: Vacatad&rsquo;s Innovative Approach</h2><p class=\"\">At Vacatad, we recognise the dual threat posed by vacant properties: <strong>they represent both a financial burden and a security risk</strong>. Our mission is to turn these potential liabilities into valuable assets, benefiting not only property owners but also the wider community. Our <strong>technology-first approach</strong> to business rates mitigation and property management is designed to address the challenges faced by vacant commercial spaces head-on.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>1. Safeguarding Your Property Through Beneficial Occupation</strong></p><p class=\"\">Vacatad&rsquo;s <strong>plug-and-play occupancy solutions</strong> are at the heart of our strategy. By transforming your vacant properties into active community assets, we can help prevent them from becoming targets for criminal activities. <strong>Our approach involves installing state-of-the-art technology that serves multiple purposes</strong>: it broadcasts free public Wi-Fi to the surrounding area, supports targeted advertising for local businesses, and creates a visible and beneficial use of the space. This not only helps deter criminal activity but also generates revenue for property owners through beneficial occupation, ensuring that your property is contributing positively to the local economy even while it is unoccupied.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>2. Ensuring Compliance in a Changing Legal Landscape</strong></p><p class=\"\">As of April 2024, significant changes to the UK&rsquo;s business rates relief regulations have made it more difficult for property owners to secure relief without facing intense scrutiny. <strong>Local authorities, driven by the need to shore up their finances amid widespread economic challenges, are adopting a tougher stance on rates relief claims</strong>. This new environment demands that property owners employ methods that are not only effective but also fully compliant with the law.</p><p class=\"\">Vacatad&rsquo;s model is meticulously designed to meet these new regulatory requirements. <strong>Our occupancy solutions are entirely legal and backed by case law, providing property owners with peace of mind</strong> in an increasingly complex legal landscape. Unlike some dubious operators in the field, our approach is transparent, legitimate, and has a proven track record of success. This ensures that our clients can continue to benefit from business rates relief without the risk of unexpected liabilities or legal challenges down the line.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>3. Enhancing Property Security</strong></p><p class=\"\">In addition to our business rates mitigation services, Vacatad also offers <strong>enhanced security solutions for vacant properties</strong>. We understand that protecting your assets is about more than just financial relief&mdash;it&rsquo;s about ensuring that your property remains secure from all threats, including those posed by criminal enterprises. <strong>Our security systems include advanced motion-sensitive cameras, 2K HDR video surveillance, and remote monitoring services</strong>. These measures are designed to deter illegal activities and provide real-time alerts to property owners and local authorities, ensuring that any suspicious activity is promptly addressed.</p><h2>The Community Impact: Revitalising Town Centres</h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad&rsquo;s solutions extend beyond the immediate benefits to property owners; they also have a profound impact on the communities in which these properties are located. <strong>By transforming vacant spaces into active hubs of local engagement, we help to revitalise town centres, boost local economies, and foster a sense of community</strong>.</p><p class=\"\">Our public Wi-Fi networks not only provide a valuable service to the local population but also offer an affordable and effective advertising platform for local businesses. <strong>This creates a virtuous cycle in which vacant properties are repurposed to serve the community</strong>, attracting foot traffic back to the area and supporting small businesses. In turn, this increased activity helps to deter criminal enterprises, making town centres safer and more vibrant places to live and work.</p><h2>A Holistic Approach to Property Management</h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and community benefit is reflected in every aspect of our service. From our <strong>plug-and-play technology</strong> to our comprehensive security solutions, we offer a <strong>holistic approach to property management</strong> that ensures vacant spaces are not just maintained, but optimised for maximum benefit.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>1. Non-Disruptive Implementation:</strong> Our technology-first solutions require minimal effort to implement. <strong>All that&rsquo;s needed is a basic power source, and our team takes care of the rest</strong>, handling all interactions with local authorities and managing the entire process from start to finish. This ensures that property owners can enjoy the benefits of our services without the usual hassles associated with property management.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>2. Transparent Operations:</strong> We believe in complete transparency at every stage of the process. <strong>Property owners receive real-time updates on the status of their properties</strong>, including occupancy details, financial savings, and any security issues that arise. This level of transparency helps to build trust and ensures that our clients are always in the loop.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>3. Repeat Savings:</strong> Should your property remain vacant after the initial relief period, our model allows for <strong>easy re-occupation</strong>, enabling you to continue benefiting from business rates relief without interruption. This flexibility is a key advantage of working with Vacatad, as it ensures that your property remains a valuable asset even during periods of extended vacancy.</p><h2>Future-Proofing Your Property</h2><p class=\"\">In today&rsquo;s uncertain economic climate, <strong>property owners cannot afford to leave their commercial spaces unprotected and underutilised</strong>. Vacatad offers a comprehensive, legally sound solution that not only safeguards your property but also transforms it into a contributor to the local economy. <strong>By choosing Vacatad, you&rsquo;re not just mitigating financial risks&mdash;you&rsquo;re investing in the future of your property and the community it serves</strong>.</p><p class=\"\">As the challenges facing Britain&rsquo;s town centres continue to evolve, <strong>Vacatad remains committed to providing innovative, effective solutions that turn risks into rewards</strong>.

The consultation's outcomes highlight an extension of the EPR \"reset period\" from six weeks to thirteen weeks, starting from 1 April 2024. This modification is designed to discourage the so-called \"box shifting\" &ndash; a manoeuvre where properties are temporarily occupied to reset the EPR and minimise business rates on vacant property.</p><p class=\"\">Moreover, the government is contemplating the introduction of a General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) for business rates.

Vacatad's model is flexible and can be adjusted to meet these new requirements, ensuring property owners can still benefit from rates relief and business rates vacant property exemptions without resorting to practices now deemed as avoidance.</p><h2><strong>Embracing the GAAR with Transparent Practices</strong></h2><p class=\"\">The potential introduction of a GAAR for business rates represents a significant shift towards greater scrutiny of rates relief practices. Vacatad welcomes this change, as our operations have always been transparent and in full compliance with the law.

    "content": "<div>In the current economic landscape, managing business rates for vacant commercial properties presents a significant challenge for landlords. With the potential for business rates in the UK to surge by over &pound;2 billion due to inflation and re-evaluation, the financial strain on property owners has become a very real and noticeable concern. This situation is only worsened when a property becomes vacant, transferring the rates liability from tenants to landlords (while turning it from a profitable asset into a non-profitable asset), thereby increasing the urgency to find viable solutions to mitigate these costs and maximise savings.<p class=\"\">Vacatad, recognising this growing concern, has introduced an innovative approach to assist property owners in navigating the complexities of business rates on vacant properties. Through a technology-driven beneficial occupation model, Vacatad offers a seamless and effective method for achieving rates relief, thereby protecting landlords from the financial burdens associated with empty commercial spaces.</p><h2><strong>Understanding Business Rates and Exemptions</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Business rates are a significant consideration for property owners, with certain types of properties in England being exempt regardless of their occupancy status. However, for the vast majority of commercial spaces that do not fall under exempt categories, the challenge of managing business rates becomes apparent as soon as the property becomes vacant. After a property has been empty for three to six months, depending on its classification, landlords are required to pay 100% of the business rates. Given the difficulty in finding tenants within this timeframe, especially in a challenging economic climate, this can lead to substantial financial losses.</p><h2><strong>The Vacatad Solution: A Comprehensive Approach to Rates Relief</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad's core philosophy centres around a passion for helping property owners protect their investments and maximise savings with minimal effort. Vacatad's technology-first method simplifies the process of achieving maximum rates relief, offering a non-disruptive and hassle-free experience for stakeholders. This approach contrasts sharply with more traditional, invasive methods of rates mitigation, providing a safer and more efficient alternative.</p><p class=\"\">Vacatad's service is designed to be non-invasive, requiring minimal logistical effort from the property owner. The plug-and-play occupancy solution demands no property modifications, ensuring a smooth implementation process. By managing all interactions with local authorities, Vacatad ensures a seamless experience for property owners, with little to no involvement required on their part.</p><h2><strong>Beneficial Occupation and Continuous Savings</strong></h2><p class=\"\">One of the standout features of the model is the beneficial occupation of properties for a period of three months. During this time, Vacatad installs the technology solution, providing public benefits such as free internet access and supporting charitable and local business activities. This not only secures beneficial occupation status for the property but also allows property owners the flexibility to find long-term tenants without any disruptions.</p><p class=\"\">Should the property remain vacant, Vacatad's sustainable savings model allows for the initiation of a re-occupation cycle, enabling continuous savings on business rates through repeated beneficial occupation periods. At the conclusion of each occupancy period, Vacatad handles the necessary communications to trigger entitlement to business rates relief, ensuring significant savings for property owners.</p><h2><strong>A Cost-Effective Model for Property Owners</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad operates on a \"Pay Only When You Save\" model, underscoring the commitment to delivering value and savings to clients without upfront costs. This model is particularly appealing to property owners looking for efficient and effective solutions to mitigate the financial impact of business rates on vacant commercial properties.</p><p class=\"\">In summary, Vacatad offers a distinctive solution for property owners facing the challenges of business rates on vacant commercial properties. Their non-invasive, technology-driven approach provides a viable alternative to more traditional methods, ensuring efficiency, ease of implementation, and minimal disruption. With Vacatad, property owners can achieve significant rates relief, protecting their bottom line and contributing positively to the visual appeal of high streets and town centres.</p></div><div>Book a Free Rates Saving Consultation</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "imageAlt": "New Business Rates Regulations: How Vacatad Aligns with Government Consultation Findings",
    "content": "<div>Introduction&nbsp;<p class=\"\">In March 2024, the UK's scrutiny of business rates, particularly in relation to vacant properties, resulted in the publication of a key government document (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65e1ffeb2f2b3b001c7cd881/SoR_A_E_V8_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Business Rates Avoidance and Evasion Consultation: Summary of Responses</a>). This paper summarised stakeholder responses to the existing challenges within the business rates system and proposed reforms to improve fairness and prevent avoidance. Notably, the government plans to extend the Empty Property Relief reset period from six to thirteen weeks, targeting strategies that temporarily occupy properties to gain relief, known as \"box shifting.\" This development signals a substantial shift for property owners, who must now adapt their strategies in an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Against this backdrop, Vacatad offers a compliant approach to property management, aiming to align with the new measures while enhancing property value and community contribution.</p></div><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/business-rates-avoidance-and-evasion-consultation\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"UK Government Business Rates Consultation Document\" class=\"article-image\" height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"posts/24-03-28-how-vacatad-aligns-with-government-consultation-findings/image2.webp\" width=\"800\"/></a><div>Vacatad's Alignment with Government Consultation Findings<p class=\"\">In light of the recent consultation, Vacatad's operations are not categorised under the problematic \"rogue agent\" activities that the government aims to combat with the new regulations. The consultation has influenced policy changes, particularly the extension of the EPR reset period, which will undoubtedly impact the management strategies of property owners. While the full consequences of this extension on property viability remain uncertain, Vacatad's business model is designed to proactively meet these changes.</p><p class=\"\">The impending anti-avoidance rule introduces an element of risk for models like Vacatad&rsquo;s, which are tailored to mitigate business rates rather than conduct traditional business activities. As regulations evolve, the company will have to ensure that its practices remain within the bounds of the new legal framework and adjust its strategies accordingly. Moreover, the variability in enforcement across different local authorities adds a layer of complexity to navigating compliance.</p><p class=\"\">Despite these potential hurdles, Vacatad's ethos is to contribute constructively to local communities while adhering to business rates obligations. This approach suggests a commitment to more than just regulatory navigation&mdash;it is about recognising and enhancing the role of vacant commercial properties in serving community and economic interests.</p><h2>Challenges Faced by Property Owners</h2><p class=\"\">The challenges facing UK property owners, especially regarding the management of empty properties and business rates, have become more pronounced following the government's consultation. Property owners are now contending with an extended EPR reset period, which could significantly affect the financial and operational strategies for vacant properties.</p><p class=\"\">The consultation has sharpened the focus on the financial and administrative burdens of business rates. The risk posed by the anti-avoidance rule to models specifically designed for rates mitigation&mdash;such as that employed by Vacatad&mdash;cannot be underestimated. The potential for varied enforcement across different local authorities further complicates the landscape, creating an uneven playing field.</p><p class=\"\">Moreover, the possibility that not all avoidance situations will be covered by the new rule introduces an element of uncertainty. Owners must navigate these changes carefully, understanding that the traditional methods of business rates relief management may no longer be viable in certain cases, and the effectiveness of innovative solutions like Vacatad's may be tested by these regulatory developments. The overall outlook suggests that property owners must brace for a tougher regulatory environment, with a need for heightened adaptability and a proactive approach to property management.</p><h2>Introducing Vacatad&rsquo;s Innovative Approach</h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad presents an innovative approach to property management in response to the updated business rates regulations. Their model, previously positioned as a proactive solution for managing vacant properties, now faces increased scrutiny due to the anti-avoidance measures introduced by the government. Despite this, Vacatad's method of installing non-permanent, technology-based installations to create beneficial occupation remains compliant with the extended EPR \"reset period.\"</p><p class=\"\">However, with the consultation highlighting the risks of anti-avoidance rules, Vacatad may need to ensure their operations are clearly distinguished from those designed to exploit loopholes in the rates system. This is particularly pertinent given the uneven application of rules across different local authorities, suggesting that Vacatad's model will need to demonstrate its legitimacy and community value in various jurisdictions.</p><p class=\"\">Vacatad's installations provide more than just occupancy; they offer community benefits, which may help to mitigate concerns about avoidance. But the company will have to carefully navigate the new landscape to continue its beneficial use of vacant spaces without falling afoul of the impending regulations.</p><h2>Beyond Compliance - The Community and Economic Impact</h2><p class=\"\">Vacatad&rsquo;s strategy for managing business rates on vacant properties extends its influence beyond regulatory adherence, touching on community and economic spheres. The innovative use of empty spaces as community assets underlines a commitment to social responsibility, but it now sits in the shadow of the new anti-avoidance legislation. Vacatad's initiatives, such as providing local Wi-Fi or supporting charities, must be clearly differentiated from avoidance tactics to withstand regulatory scrutiny.</p><p class=\"\">Economic impacts are also at play, with the potential for local economies to benefit from Vacatad's approach. Yet, the viability of these initiatives could be challenged by the broader interpretation of what constitutes genuine business activity under the anti-avoidance rule. Despite these hurdles, Vacatad's model has the potential to shift perceptions of empty properties from fiscal liabilities to community resources. This will require a delicate balance, ensuring that activities are robust against accusations of avoidance while still offering tangible benefits to the community.</p><p class=\"\">The success of Vacatad&rsquo;s approach will likely influence property management trends, suggesting that future strategies should be as dynamic and community-focused as they are compliant. This shift could signify a move towards more inclusive urban development, with empty properties playing a pivotal role in revitalising communities if they can navigate the complexities of the new business rates landscape.</p><h2>The Future of Property Management and Business Rates Relief</h2><p class=\"\">The introduction of Vacatad's approach against the backdrop of changing business rates policies marks a potential turning point for property management. This shift encourages property owners to adopt strategies that integrate social responsibility into their business models. The effectiveness of such innovative solutions will be instrumental in shaping future property management practices, particularly as they navigate the complexities introduced by anti-avoidance legislation.</p><p class=\"\">Looking forward, the emphasis on community-focused outcomes, such as those Vacatad aims to deliver, may inspire a reevaluation of the regulatory framework, encouraging policies that support rather than penalise socially beneficial property uses. The success of these models also suggests increased stakeholder collaboration, which could redefine the commercial property sector's role in urban development and community building.</p><p class=\"\">The adoption of Vacatad-like strategies offers a glimpse into a future where property management is synonymous with sustainability, community welfare, and economic regeneration. As business rates legislation evolves, it will likely catalyse further innovation in the sector, with a focus on flexibility and adaptability to meet the needs of communities and the imperatives of local governance.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class=\"\">In conclusion, the recent business rates consultation has underscored the urgency for property management to evolve. Vacatad's response to this call to action reflects a strategic pivot towards innovative, socially responsible management of vacant properties. While the consultation indicates a challenging road ahead, with heightened regulatory scrutiny and the risk of uneven enforcement, there also lies an opportunity for property owners to reimagine the value of their assets.</p><p class=\"\">Vacatad's model, with its community-centric benefits and compliance efforts, offers a blueprint for this transformation. However, the effectiveness of such approaches in a landscape shaped by anti-avoidance rules will require vigilance and adaptability. Property owners must now weigh the financial implications of extended relief periods against the potential to contribute positively to the community.</p><p class=\"\">Ultimately, the future of property management hinges on the ability to align with new regulations while fostering the economic and social fabric of urban spaces. The commitment to innovation, community engagement, and proactive strategy will be crucial as property owners navigate the complexities of this new regulatory environment.</p><h3>Get in touch today</h3></div><div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "imageAlt": "The Vacatad Edge: Transforming Business Rates on Empty Properties",
    "content": "<div>As legislative frameworks evolve and commercial property dynamics fluctuate, the management of business rates on vacant properties has become a pivotal financial challenge for property owners. The enactment of the 2007 Rating (Empty Properties) Act, imposing business rates on most commercial properties after three months of vacancy, significantly affects various non-domestic properties, including offices, retail spaces, and industrial sites. With an uptick in commercial vacancies, finding strategies to mitigate or bypass these rates is increasingly critical.<p class=\"\">For property owners keen on managing their financial obligations effectively, understanding the diverse routes to obtain relief or exemption from business rates is indispensable. This article explores several scenarios that might change how you manage vacant properties, highlighting innovative solutions to tackle business rates' complexities.</p><h2><strong>Complete Exemptions from Business Rates</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Specific property types in England, irrespective of their occupancy status, are wholly exempt from business rates. These include agricultural properties, facilities for disabled individuals' training or welfare, and buildings earmarked for religious use.</p><h2><strong>Extended Relief for Vacant Properties</strong></h2><p class=\"\">Certain properties can benefit from extended relief beyond the standard three-month period. Industrial properties enjoy an extra three months of exemption, listed buildings are exempt until reoccupied, properties with a rateable value below &pound;2,900 remain exempt until reoccupied, and properties owned by charities or community amateur sports clubs remain entirely exempt if they continue serving their initial purpose.</p><h2><strong>Pioneering Business Rate Relief Solutions</strong></h2><h3>Beneficial Occupation and Vacatad's Model</h3><p class=\"\">The concept of \"beneficial occupation\" offers a progressive means to qualify for business rates relief. Vacatad exemplifies this strategy by briefly occupying properties and deploying a technology solution that delivers public benefits, like free internet and targeted advertising, thus achieving beneficial occupation status. This temporary occupancy allows property owners to continue marketing their space to potential long-term tenants without interruption.</p><h3>Short-term Re-occupation</h3><p class=\"\">Resetting the exemption clock through short-term re-occupation allows for an additional relief period after the property becomes vacant again. This approach requires diligent management to ensure regulatory compliance and optimise potential savings on business rates.</p><h3>Leasing to Charitable Organisations</h3><p class=\"\">Renting commercial spaces to charities can drastically cut business rate liabilities, as charities are eligible for up to 100% relief. This strategy provides financial advantages and supports charitable causes, positively impacting the community.</p><h2><strong>Mastering Exemptions and Relief</strong></h2><p class=\"\">It's vital for property owners to understand the specifics of each exemption or relief scenario thoroughly. Being proactive in exploring all options, including temporary occupancy solutions like Vacatad's model, is key to managing business rates more efficiently. Each situation presents unique savings opportunities, and a strategic approach to property management can result in significant financial gains.</p><p class=\"\">In the intricate landscape of commercial property management, staying well-informed and considering innovative solutions are crucial for successfully navigating business rates. Adopting strategic occupancy solutions and leveraging exemptions can pave the way for considerable savings and more effective property management.</p></div><div><strong>Discover Your Savings Potential with Vacatad</strong><p class=\"\">If the financial strain of managing empty commercial properties is a concern for you, it&rsquo;s time to explore how much you could save with Vacatad.
